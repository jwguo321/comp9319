000059 
000060 I.
000061 
000062 To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
000063 him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses
000064 and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt
000065 any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that
000066 one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but
000067 admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect
000068 reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a
000069 lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never
000070 spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They
000071 were admirable things for the observer--excellent for drawing the
000072 veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner
000073 to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
000074 adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which
000075 might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a
000076 sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power
000077 lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a
000078 nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and
000079 that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable
000080 memory.
000081 
000082 I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us
000083 away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the
000084 home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first
000085 finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to
000086 absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of
000087 society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in
000088 Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from
000089 week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the
000090 drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still,
000091 as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his
000092 immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in
000093 following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which
000094 had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time
000095 to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons
000096 to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up
000097 of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee,
000098 and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so
000099 delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland.
000100 Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely
000101 shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of
000102 my former friend and companion.
000103 
000104 One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was
000105 returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to
000106 civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I
000107 passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated
000108 in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the
000109 Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes
000110 again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers.
000111 His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw
000112 his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against
000113 the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head
000114 sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who
000115 knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their
000116 own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his
000117 drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
000118 problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which
000119 had formerly been in part my own.
000120 
000121 His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I
000122 think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly
000123 eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars,
000124 and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he
000125 stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular
000126 introspective fashion.
000127 
000128 "Wedlock suits you," he remarked. "I think, Watson, that you have
000129 put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you."
000130 
000131 "Seven!" I answered.
000132 
000133 "Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more,
000134 I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not
000135 tell me that you intended to go into harness."
000136 
000137 "Then, how do you know?"
000138 
000139 "I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting
000140 yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and
000141 careless servant girl?"
000142 
000143 "My dear Holmes," said I, "this is too much. You would certainly
000144 have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true
000145 that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful
000146 mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can't imagine how you
000147 deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has
000148 given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it
000149 out."
000150 
000151 He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands
000152 together.
000153 
000154 "It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the
000155 inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it,
000156 the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they
000157 have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round
000158 the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it.
000159 Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile
000160 weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting
000161 specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a
000162 gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black
000163 mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge
000164 on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted
000165 his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce
000166 him to be an active member of the medical profession."
000167 
000168 I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his
000169 process of deduction. "When I hear you give your reasons," I
000170 remarked, "the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously
000171 simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each
000172 successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you
000173 explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good
000174 as yours."
000175 
000176 "Quite so," he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing
000177 himself down into an armchair. "You see, but you do not observe.
000178 The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen
000179 the steps which lead up from the hall to this room."
000180 
000181 "Frequently."
000182 
000183 "How often?"
000184 
000185 "Well, some hundreds of times."
000186 
000187 "Then how many are there?"
000188 
000189 "How many? I don't know."
000190 
000191 "Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is
000192 just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps,
000193 because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are
000194 interested in these little problems, and since you are good
000195 enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you
000196 may be interested in this." He threw over a sheet of thick,
000197 pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table.
000198 "It came by the last post," said he. "Read it aloud."
000199 
000200 The note was undated, and without either signature or address.
000201 
000202 "There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight
000203 o'clock," it said, "a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a
000204 matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of
000205 the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may
000206 safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which
000207 can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all
000208 quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do
000209 not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask."
000210 
000211 "This is indeed a mystery," I remarked. "What do you imagine that
000212 it means?"
000213 
000214 "I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before
000215 one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit
000216 theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself.
000217 What do you deduce from it?"
000218 
000219 I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was
000220 written.
000221 
000222 "The man who wrote it was presumably well to do," I remarked,
000223 endeavouring to imitate my companion's processes. "Such paper
000224 could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly
000225 strong and stiff."
000226 
000227 "Peculiar--that is the very word," said Holmes. "It is not an
000228 English paper at all. Hold it up to the light."
000229 
000230 I did so, and saw a large "E" with a small "g," a "P," and a
000231 large "G" with a small "t" woven into the texture of the paper.
000232 
000233 "What do you make of that?" asked Holmes.
000234 
000235 "The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather."
000236 
000237 "Not at all. The 'G' with the small 't' stands for
000238 'Gesellschaft,' which is the German for 'Company.' It is a
000239 customary contraction like our 'Co.' 'P,' of course, stands for
000240 'Papier.' Now for the 'Eg.' Let us glance at our Continental
000241 Gazetteer." He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves.
000242 "Eglow, Eglonitz--here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking
000243 country--in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. 'Remarkable as being
000244 the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous
000245 glass-factories and paper-mills.' Ha, ha, my boy, what do you
000246 make of that?" His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue
000247 triumphant cloud from his cigarette.
000248 
000249 "The paper was made in Bohemia," I said.
000250 
000251 "Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you
000252 note the peculiar construction of the sentence--'This account of
000253 you we have from all quarters received.' A Frenchman or Russian
000254 could not have written that. It is the German who is so
000255 uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover
000256 what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and
000257 prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if
000258 I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts."
000259 
000260 As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses' hoofs and
000261 grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the
000262 bell. Holmes whistled.
000263 
000264 "A pair, by the sound," said he. "Yes," he continued, glancing
000265 out of the window. "A nice little brougham and a pair of
000266 beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There's money in
000267 this case, Watson, if there is nothing else."
000268 
000269 "I think that I had better go, Holmes."
000270 
000271 "Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my
000272 Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity
000273 to miss it."
000274 
000275 "But your client--"
000276 
000277 "Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he
000278 comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best
000279 attention."
000280 
000281 A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and
000282 in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there
000283 was a loud and authoritative tap.
000284 
000285 "Come in!" said Holmes.
000286 
000287 A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six
000288 inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His
000289 dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked
000290 upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed
000291 across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while
000292 the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined
000293 with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch
000294 which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended
000295 halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with
000296 rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence
000297 which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a
000298 broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper
000299 part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black
000300 vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment,
000301 for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower
000302 part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character,
000303 with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive
000304 of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy.
000305 
000306 "You had my note?" he asked with a deep harsh voice and a
000307 strongly marked German accent. "I told you that I would call." He
000308 looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to
000309 address.
000310 
000311 "Pray take a seat," said Holmes. "This is my friend and
000312 colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me
000313 in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?"
000314 
000315 "You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman.
000316 I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour
000317 and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most
000318 extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate
000319 with you alone."
000320 
000321 I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me
000322 back into my chair. "It is both, or none," said he. "You may say
000323 before this gentleman anything which you may say to me."
000324 
000325 The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. "Then I must begin," said
000326 he, "by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at
000327 the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At
000328 present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it
000329 may have an influence upon European history."
000330 
000331 "I promise," said Holmes.
000332 
000333 "And I."
000334 
000335 "You will excuse this mask," continued our strange visitor. "The
000336 august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to
000337 you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have
000338 just called myself is not exactly my own."
000339 
000340 "I was aware of it," said Holmes dryly.
000341 
000342 "The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution
000343 has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense
000344 scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of
000345 Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House
000346 of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia."
000347 
000348 "I was also aware of that," murmured Holmes, settling himself
000349 down in his armchair and closing his eyes.
000350 
000351 Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid,
000352 lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him
000353 as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe.
000354 Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his
000355 gigantic client.
000356 
000357 "If your Majesty would condescend to state your case," he
000358 remarked, "I should be better able to advise you."
000359 
000360 The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in
000361 uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he
000362 tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. "You
000363 are right," he cried; "I am the King. Why should I attempt to
000364 conceal it?"
000365 
000366 "Why, indeed?" murmured Holmes. "Your Majesty had not spoken
000367 before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich
000368 Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and
000369 hereditary King of Bohemia."
000370 
000371 "But you can understand," said our strange visitor, sitting down
000372 once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, "you
000373 can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in
000374 my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not
000375 confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I
000376 have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting
000377 you."
000378 
000379 "Then, pray consult," said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more.
000380 
000381 "The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a
000382 lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known
000383 adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you."
000384 
000385 "Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor," murmured Holmes without
000386 opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of
000387 docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it
000388 was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not
000389 at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography
000390 sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a
000391 staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea
000392 fishes.
000393 
000394 "Let me see!" said Holmes. "Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year
000395 1858. Contralto--hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera
000396 of Warsaw--yes! Retired from operatic stage--ha! Living in
000397 London--quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled
000398 with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and
000399 is now desirous of getting those letters back."
000400 
000401 "Precisely so. But how--"
000402 
000403 "Was there a secret marriage?"
000404 
000405 "None."
000406 
000407 "No legal papers or certificates?"
000408 
000409 "None."
000410 
000411 "Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should
000412 produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is
000413 she to prove their authenticity?"
000414 
000415 "There is the writing."
000416 
000417 "Pooh, pooh! Forgery."
000418 
000419 "My private note-paper."
000420 
000421 "Stolen."
000422 
000423 "My own seal."
000424 
000425 "Imitated."
000426 
000427 "My photograph."
000428 
000429 "Bought."
000430 
000431 "We were both in the photograph."
000432 
000433 "Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an
000434 indiscretion."
000435 
000436 "I was mad--insane."
000437 
000438 "You have compromised yourself seriously."
000439 
000440 "I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now."
000441 
000442 "It must be recovered."
000443 
000444 "We have tried and failed."
000445 
000446 "Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought."
000447 
000448 "She will not sell."
000449 
000450 "Stolen, then."
000451 
000452 "Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked
000453 her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice
000454 she has been waylaid. There has been no result."
000455 
000456 "No sign of it?"
000457 
000458 "Absolutely none."
000459 
000460 Holmes laughed. "It is quite a pretty little problem," said he.
000461 
000462 "But a very serious one to me," returned the King reproachfully.
000463 
000464 "Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the
000465 photograph?"
000466 
000467 "To ruin me."
000468 
000469 "But how?"
000470 
000471 "I am about to be married."
000472 
000473 "So I have heard."
000474 
000475 "To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the
000476 King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her
000477 family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a
000478 doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end."
000479 
000480 "And Irene Adler?"
000481 
000482 "Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I
000483 know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul
000484 of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and
000485 the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry
000486 another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not
000487 go--none."
000488 
000489 "You are sure that she has not sent it yet?"
000490 
000491 "I am sure."
000492 
000493 "And why?"
000494 
000495 "Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the
000496 betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday."
000497 
000498 "Oh, then we have three days yet," said Holmes with a yawn. "That
000499 is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to
000500 look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in
000501 London for the present?"
000502 
000503 "Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the
000504 Count Von Kramm."
000505 
000506 "Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress."
000507 
000508 "Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety."
000509 
000510 "Then, as to money?"
000511 
000512 "You have carte blanche."
000513 
000514 "Absolutely?"
000515 
000516 "I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom
000517 to have that photograph."
000518 
000519 "And for present expenses?"
000520 
000521 The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak
000522 and laid it on the table.
000523 
000524 "There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in
000525 notes," he said.
000526 
000527 Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and
000528 handed it to him.
000529 
000530 "And Mademoiselle's address?" he asked.
000531 
000532 "Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John's Wood."
000533 
000534 Holmes took a note of it. "One other question," said he. "Was the
000535 photograph a cabinet?"
000536 
000537 "It was."
000538 
000539 "Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon
000540 have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson," he added,
000541 as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If
000542 you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three
000543 o'clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you."
000544 
000545 
000546 II.
000547 
000548 At three o'clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had
000549 not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the
000550 house shortly after eight o'clock in the morning. I sat down
000551 beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him,
000552 however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his
000553 inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and
000554 strange features which were associated with the two crimes which
000555 I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the
000556 exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own.
000557 Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my
000558 friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of
000559 a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a
000560 pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the
000561 quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most
000562 inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable
000563 success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to
000564 enter into my head.
000565 
000566 It was close upon four before the door opened, and a
000567 drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an
000568 inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room.
000569 Accustomed as I was to my friend's amazing powers in the use of
000570 disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it
000571 was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he
000572 emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old.
000573 Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in
000574 front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes.
000575 
000576 "Well, really!" he cried, and then he choked and laughed again
000577 until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the
000578 chair.
000579 
000580 "What is it?"
000581 
000582 "It's quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I
000583 employed my morning, or what I ended by doing."
000584 
000585 "I can't imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the
000586 habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler."
000587 
000588 "Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you,
000589 however. I left the house a little after eight o'clock this
000590 morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a
000591 wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of
000592 them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found
000593 Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but
000594 built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock
000595 to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well
000596 furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those
000597 preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open.
000598 Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window
000599 could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round
000600 it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without
000601 noting anything else of interest.
000602 
000603 "I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that
000604 there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the
000605 garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses,
000606 and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two
000607 fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire
000608 about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in
000609 the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but
000610 whose biographies I was compelled to listen to."
000611 
000612 "And what of Irene Adler?" I asked.
000613 
000614 "Oh, she has turned all the men's heads down in that part. She is
000615 the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the
000616 Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts,
000617 drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for
000618 dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings.
000619 Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark,
000620 handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and
000621 often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See
000622 the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him
000623 home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him.
000624 When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up
000625 and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan
000626 of campaign.
000627 
000628 "This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the
000629 matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the
000630 relation between them, and what the object of his repeated
000631 visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the
000632 former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his
000633 keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this
000634 question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony
000635 Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman's chambers in the
000636 Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my
000637 inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to
000638 let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the
000639 situation."
000640 
000641 "I am following you closely," I answered.
000642 
000643 "I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab
000644 drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a
000645 remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached--evidently
000646 the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a
000647 great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the
000648 maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly
000649 at home.
000650 
000651 "He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch
000652 glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and
000653 down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see
000654 nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than
000655 before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from
000656 his pocket and looked at it earnestly, 'Drive like the devil,' he
000657 shouted, 'first to Gross & Hankey's in Regent Street, and then to
000658 the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if
000659 you do it in twenty minutes!'
000660 
000661 "Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do
000662 well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau,
000663 the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under
000664 his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of
000665 the buckles. It hadn't pulled up before she shot out of the hall
000666 door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment,
000667 but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for.
000668 
000669 "'The Church of St. Monica, John,' she cried, 'and half a
000670 sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.'
000671 
000672 "This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing
000673 whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her
000674 landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked
000675 twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could
000676 object. 'The Church of St. Monica,' said I, 'and half a sovereign
000677 if you reach it in twenty minutes.' It was twenty-five minutes to
000678 twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind.
000679 
000680 "My cabby drove fast. I don't think I ever drove faster, but the
000681 others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their
000682 steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid
000683 the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there
000684 save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who
000685 seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three
000686 standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side
000687 aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church.
000688 Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to
000689 me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards
000690 me.
000691 
000692 "'Thank God,' he cried. 'You'll do. Come! Come!'
000693 
000694 "'What then?' I asked.
000695 
000696 "'Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won't be legal.'
000697 
000698 "I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was
000699 I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear,
000700 and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally
000701 assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to
000702 Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and
000703 there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady
000704 on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was
000705 the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my
000706 life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just
000707 now. It seems that there had been some informality about their
000708 license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them
000709 without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance
000710 saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in
000711 search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean
000712 to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion."
000713 
000714 "This is a very unexpected turn of affairs," said I; "and what
000715 then?"
000716 
000717 "Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if
000718 the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate
000719 very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church
000720 door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and
000721 she to her own house. 'I shall drive out in the park at five as
000722 usual,' she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove
000723 away in different directions, and I went off to make my own
000724 arrangements."
000725 
000726 "Which are?"
000727 
000728 "Some cold beef and a glass of beer," he answered, ringing the
000729 bell. "I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to
000730 be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want
000731 your co-operation."
000732 
000733 "I shall be delighted."
000734 
000735 "You don't mind breaking the law?"
000736 
000737 "Not in the least."
000738 
000739 "Nor running a chance of arrest?"
000740 
000741 "Not in a good cause."
000742 
000743 "Oh, the cause is excellent!"
000744 
000745 "Then I am your man."
000746 
000747 "I was sure that I might rely on you."
000748 
000749 "But what is it you wish?"
000750 
000751 "When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to
000752 you. Now," he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that
000753 our landlady had provided, "I must discuss it while I eat, for I
000754 have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must
000755 be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns
000756 from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."
000757 
000758 "And what then?"
000759 
000760 "You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to
000761 occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must
000762 not interfere, come what may. You understand?"
000763 
000764 "I am to be neutral?"
000765 
000766 "To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small
000767 unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being
000768 conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the
000769 sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close
000770 to that open window."
000771 
000772 "Yes."
000773 
000774 "You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you."
000775 
000776 "Yes."
000777 
000778 "And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what
000779 I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of
000780 fire. You quite follow me?"
000781 
000782 "Entirely."
000783 
000784 "It is nothing very formidable," he said, taking a long cigar-shaped
000785 roll from his pocket. "It is an ordinary plumber's smoke-rocket,
000786 fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting.
000787 Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire,
000788 it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then
000789 walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten
000790 minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?"
000791 
000792 "I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you,
000793 and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry
000794 of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street."
000795 
000796 "Precisely."
000797 
000798 "Then you may entirely rely on me."
000799 
000800 "That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I
000801 prepare for the new role I have to play."
000802 
000803 He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in
000804 the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist
000805 clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white
000806 tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and
000807 benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have
000808 equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His
000809 expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every
000810 fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as
000811 science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in
000812 crime.
000813 
000814 It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still
000815 wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in
000816 Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just
000817 being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge,
000818 waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such
000819 as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description,
000820 but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On
000821 the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was
000822 remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men
000823 smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his
000824 wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and
000825 several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with
000826 cigars in their mouths.
000827 
000828 "You see," remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of
000829 the house, "this marriage rather simplifies matters. The
000830 photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are
000831 that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey
000832 Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his
000833 princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the
000834 photograph?"
000835 
000836 "Where, indeed?"
000837 
000838 "It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is
000839 cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman's
000840 dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid
000841 and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We
000842 may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her."
000843 
000844 "Where, then?"
000845 
000846 "Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But
000847 I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive,
000848 and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it
000849 over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but
000850 she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be
000851 brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she
000852 had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she
000853 can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house."
000854 
000855 "But it has twice been burgled."
000856 
000857 "Pshaw! They did not know how to look."
000858 
000859 "But how will you look?"
000860 
000861 "I will not look."
000862 
000863 "What then?"
000864 
000865 "I will get her to show me."
000866 
000867 "But she will refuse."
000868 
000869 "She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is
000870 her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter."
000871 
000872 As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round
000873 the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which
000874 rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of
000875 the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in
000876 the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another
000877 loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce
000878 quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who
000879 took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder,
000880 who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and
000881 in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was
000882 the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who
000883 struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes
000884 dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached
000885 her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood
000886 running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to
000887 their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while
000888 a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle
000889 without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to
000890 attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her,
000891 had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her
000892 superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking
000893 back into the street.
000894 
000895 "Is the poor gentleman much hurt?" she asked.
000896 
000897 "He is dead," cried several voices.
000898 
000899 "No, no, there's life in him!" shouted another. "But he'll be
000900 gone before you can get him to hospital."
000901 
000902 "He's a brave fellow," said a woman. "They would have had the
000903 lady's purse and watch if it hadn't been for him. They were a
000904 gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he's breathing now."
000905 
000906 "He can't lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?"
000907 
000908 "Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable
000909 sofa. This way, please!"
000910 
000911 Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out
000912 in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings
000913 from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the
000914 blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay
000915 upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with
000916 compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I
000917 know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life
000918 than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was
000919 conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited
000920 upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery
000921 to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted
000922 to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under
000923 my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are
000924 but preventing her from injuring another.
000925 
000926 Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man
000927 who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the
000928 window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the
000929 signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of "Fire!" The
000930 word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of
000931 spectators, well dressed and ill--gentlemen, ostlers, and
000932 servant-maids--joined in a general shriek of "Fire!" Thick clouds
000933 of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I
000934 caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice
000935 of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm.
000936 Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner
000937 of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my
000938 friend's arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar.
000939 He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we
000940 had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the
000941 Edgeware Road.
000942 
000943 "You did it very nicely, Doctor," he remarked. "Nothing could
000944 have been better. It is all right."
000945 
000946 "You have the photograph?"
000947 
000948 "I know where it is."
000949 
000950 "And how did you find out?"
000951 
000952 "She showed me, as I told you she would."
000953 
000954 "I am still in the dark."
000955 
000956 "I do not wish to make a mystery," said he, laughing. "The matter
000957 was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the
000958 street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening."
000959 
000960 "I guessed as much."
000961 
000962 "Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in
000963 the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand
000964 to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick."
000965 
000966 "That also I could fathom."
000967 
000968 "Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else
000969 could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room
000970 which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was
000971 determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for
000972 air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your
000973 chance."
000974 
000975 "How did that help you?"
000976 
000977 "It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on
000978 fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she
000979 values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have
000980 more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the
000981 Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in
000982 the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby;
000983 an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to
000984 me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious
000985 to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it.
000986 The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were
000987 enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The
000988 photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the
000989 right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a
000990 glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it
000991 was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed
000992 from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making
000993 my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to
000994 attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had
000995 come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to
000996 wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all."
000997 
000998 "And now?" I asked.
000999 
001000 "Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King
001001 to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be
001002 shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is
001003 probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the
001004 photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain
001005 it with his own hands."
001006 
001007 "And when will you call?"
001008 
001009 "At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall
001010 have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage
001011 may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to
001012 the King without delay."
001013 
001014 We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was
001015 searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said:
001016 
001017 "Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."
001018 
001019 There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the
001020 greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had
001021 hurried by.
001022 
001023 "I've heard that voice before," said Holmes, staring down the
001024 dimly lit street. "Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have
001025 been."
001026 
001027 
001028 III.
001029 
001030 I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our
001031 toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed
001032 into the room.
001033 
001034 "You have really got it!" he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by
001035 either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face.
001036 
001037 "Not yet."
001038 
001039 "But you have hopes?"
001040 
001041 "I have hopes."
001042 
001043 "Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."
001044 
001045 "We must have a cab."
001046 
001047 "No, my brougham is waiting."
001048 
001049 "Then that will simplify matters." We descended and started off
001050 once more for Briony Lodge.
001051 
001052 "Irene Adler is married," remarked Holmes.
001053 
001054 "Married! When?"
001055 
001056 "Yesterday."
001057 
001058 "But to whom?"
001059 
001060 "To an English lawyer named Norton."
001061 
001062 "But she could not love him."
001063 
001064 "I am in hopes that she does."
001065 
001066 "And why in hopes?"
001067 
001068 "Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future
001069 annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your
001070 Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason
001071 why she should interfere with your Majesty's plan."
001072 
001073 "It is true. And yet--Well! I wish she had been of my own
001074 station! What a queen she would have made!" He relapsed into a
001075 moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in
001076 Serpentine Avenue.
001077 
001078 The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood
001079 upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped
001080 from the brougham.
001081 
001082 "Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?" said she.
001083 
001084 "I am Mr. Holmes," answered my companion, looking at her with a
001085 questioning and rather startled gaze.
001086 
001087 "Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She
001088 left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing
001089 Cross for the Continent."
001090 
001091 "What!" Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and
001092 surprise. "Do you mean that she has left England?"
001093 
001094 "Never to return."
001095 
001096 "And the papers?" asked the King hoarsely. "All is lost."
001097 
001098 "We shall see." He pushed past the servant and rushed into the
001099 drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was
001100 scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and
001101 open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before
001102 her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small
001103 sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a
001104 photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler
001105 herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to
001106 "Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for." My friend
001107 tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at
001108 midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
001109 
001110 "MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,--You really did it very well. You
001111 took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a
001112 suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I
001113 began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had
001114 been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly
001115 be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this,
001116 you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became
001117 suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind
001118 old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress
001119 myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage
001120 of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to
001121 watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call
001122 them, and came down just as you departed.
001123 
001124 "Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was
001125 really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock
001126 Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and
001127 started for the Temple to see my husband.
001128 
001129 "We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by
001130 so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when
001131 you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in
001132 peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may
001133 do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly
001134 wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a
001135 weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might
001136 take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to
001137 possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
001138 
001139                                       "Very truly yours,
001140                                    "IRENE NORTON, ne ADLER."
001141 
001142 "What a woman--oh, what a woman!" cried the King of Bohemia, when
001143 we had all three read this epistle. "Did I not tell you how quick
001144 and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen?
001145 Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?"
001146 
001147 "From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a
001148 very different level to your Majesty," said Holmes coldly. "I am
001149 sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty's business
001150 to a more successful conclusion."
001151 
001152 "On the contrary, my dear sir," cried the King; "nothing could be
001153 more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The
001154 photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire."
001155 
001156 "I am glad to hear your Majesty say so."
001157 
001158 "I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can
001159 reward you. This ring--" He slipped an emerald snake ring from
001160 his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand.
001161 
001162 "Your Majesty has something which I should value even more
001163 highly," said Holmes.
001164 
001165 "You have but to name it."
001166 
001167 "This photograph!"
001168 
001169 The King stared at him in amazement.
001170 
001171 "Irene's photograph!" he cried. "Certainly, if you wish it."
001172 
001173 "I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the
001174 matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning." He
001175 bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the
001176 King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his
001177 chambers.
001178 
001179 And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom
001180 of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were
001181 beaten by a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the
001182 cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And
001183 when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her
001184 photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman.
001185 
001186 
001187 
001188 ADVENTURE II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
001189 
001190 I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, one day in the
001191 autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a
001192 very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair.
001193 With an apology for my intrusion, I was about to withdraw when
001194 Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door
001195 behind me.
001196 
001197 "You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear
001198 Watson," he said cordially.
001199 
001200 "I was afraid that you were engaged."
001201 
001202 "So I am. Very much so."
001203 
001204 "Then I can wait in the next room."
001205 
001206 "Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and
001207 helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no
001208 doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."
001209 
001210 The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of
001211 greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small
001212 fat-encircled eyes.
001213 
001214 "Try the settee," said Holmes, relapsing into his armchair and
001215 putting his fingertips together, as was his custom when in
001216 judicial moods. "I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love
001217 of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum
001218 routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by
001219 the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you
001220 will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own
001221 little adventures."
001222 
001223 "Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me," I
001224 observed.
001225 
001226 "You will remember that I remarked the other day, just before we
001227 went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary
001228 Sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary
001229 combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more
001230 daring than any effort of the imagination."
001231 
001232 "A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting."
001233 
001234 "You did, Doctor, but none the less you must come round to my
001235 view, for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you
001236 until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to
001237 be right. Now, Mr. Jabez Wilson here has been good enough to call
001238 upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to
001239 be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some
001240 time. You have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique
001241 things are very often connected not with the larger but with the
001242 smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for
001243 doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. As far as I
001244 have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present
001245 case is an instance of crime or not, but the course of events is
001246 certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to.
001247 Perhaps, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great kindness to
001248 recommence your narrative. I ask you not merely because my friend
001249 Dr. Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the
001250 peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every
001251 possible detail from your lips. As a rule, when I have heard some
001252 slight indication of the course of events, I am able to guide
001253 myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my
001254 memory. In the present instance I am forced to admit that the
001255 facts are, to the best of my belief, unique."
001256 
001257 The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some
001258 little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper from the
001259 inside pocket of his greatcoat. As he glanced down the
001260 advertisement column, with his head thrust forward and the paper
001261 flattened out upon his knee, I took a good look at the man and
001262 endeavoured, after the fashion of my companion, to read the
001263 indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance.
001264 
001265 I did not gain very much, however, by my inspection. Our visitor
001266 bore every mark of being an average commonplace British
001267 tradesman, obese, pompous, and slow. He wore rather baggy grey
001268 shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat,
001269 unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy
001270 Albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as
001271 an ornament. A frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a
001272 wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. Altogether,
001273 look as I would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save
001274 his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and
001275 discontent upon his features.
001276 
001277 Sherlock Holmes' quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook
001278 his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances.
001279 "Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual
001280 labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has
001281 been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of
001282 writing lately, I can deduce nothing else."
001283 
001284 Mr. Jabez Wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger
001285 upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.
001286 
001287 "How, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, Mr.
001288 Holmes?" he asked. "How did you know, for example, that I did
001289 manual labour. It's as true as gospel, for I began as a ship's
001290 carpenter."
001291 
001292 "Your hands, my dear sir. Your right hand is quite a size larger
001293 than your left. You have worked with it, and the muscles are more
001294 developed."
001295 
001296 "Well, the snuff, then, and the Freemasonry?"
001297 
001298 "I won't insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that,
001299 especially as, rather against the strict rules of your order, you
001300 use an arc-and-compass breastpin."
001301 
001302 "Ah, of course, I forgot that. But the writing?"
001303 
001304 "What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for
001305 five inches, and the left one with the smooth patch near the
001306 elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"
001307 
001308 "Well, but China?"
001309 
001310 "The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right
001311 wrist could only have been done in China. I have made a small
001312 study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature
001313 of the subject. That trick of staining the fishes' scales of a
001314 delicate pink is quite peculiar to China. When, in addition, I
001315 see a Chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter
001316 becomes even more simple."
001317 
001318 Mr. Jabez Wilson laughed heavily. "Well, I never!" said he. "I
001319 thought at first that you had done something clever, but I see
001320 that there was nothing in it, after all."
001321 
001322 "I begin to think, Watson," said Holmes, "that I make a mistake
001323 in explaining. 'Omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my
001324 poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if I
001325 am so candid. Can you not find the advertisement, Mr. Wilson?"
001326 
001327 "Yes, I have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger
001328 planted halfway down the column. "Here it is. This is what began
001329 it all. You just read it for yourself, sir."
001330 
001331 I took the paper from him and read as follows:
001332 
001333 "TO THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE: On account of the bequest of the late
001334 Ezekiah Hopkins, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, U. S. A., there is now
001335 another vacancy open which entitles a member of the League to a
001336 salary of 4 pounds a week for purely nominal services. All
001337 red-headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age
001338 of twenty-one years, are eligible. Apply in person on Monday, at
001339 eleven o'clock, to Duncan Ross, at the offices of the League, 7
001340 Pope's Court, Fleet Street."
001341 
001342 "What on earth does this mean?" I ejaculated after I had twice
001343 read over the extraordinary announcement.
001344 
001345 Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when
001346 in high spirits. "It is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?"
001347 said he. "And now, Mr. Wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us
001348 all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this
001349 advertisement had upon your fortunes. You will first make a note,
001350 Doctor, of the paper and the date."
001351 
001352 "It is The Morning Chronicle of April 27, 1890. Just two months
001353 ago."
001354 
001355 "Very good. Now, Mr. Wilson?"
001356 
001357 "Well, it is just as I have been telling you, Mr. Sherlock
001358 Holmes," said Jabez Wilson, mopping his forehead; "I have a small
001359 pawnbroker's business at Coburg Square, near the City. It's not a
001360 very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than
001361 just give me a living. I used to be able to keep two assistants,
001362 but now I only keep one; and I would have a job to pay him but
001363 that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the
001364 business."
001365 
001366 "What is the name of this obliging youth?" asked Sherlock Holmes.
001367 
001368 "His name is Vincent Spaulding, and he's not such a youth,
001369 either. It's hard to say his age. I should not wish a smarter
001370 assistant, Mr. Holmes; and I know very well that he could better
001371 himself and earn twice what I am able to give him. But, after
001372 all, if he is satisfied, why should I put ideas in his head?"
001373 
001374 "Why, indeed? You seem most fortunate in having an employ who
001375 comes under the full market price. It is not a common experience
001376 among employers in this age. I don't know that your assistant is
001377 not as remarkable as your advertisement."
001378 
001379 "Oh, he has his faults, too," said Mr. Wilson. "Never was such a
001380 fellow for photography. Snapping away with a camera when he ought
001381 to be improving his mind, and then diving down into the cellar
001382 like a rabbit into its hole to develop his pictures. That is his
001383 main fault, but on the whole he's a good worker. There's no vice
001384 in him."
001385 
001386 "He is still with you, I presume?"
001387 
001388 "Yes, sir. He and a girl of fourteen, who does a bit of simple
001389 cooking and keeps the place clean--that's all I have in the
001390 house, for I am a widower and never had any family. We live very
001391 quietly, sir, the three of us; and we keep a roof over our heads
001392 and pay our debts, if we do nothing more.
001393 
001394 "The first thing that put us out was that advertisement.
001395 Spaulding, he came down into the office just this day eight
001396 weeks, with this very paper in his hand, and he says:
001397 
001398 "'I wish to the Lord, Mr. Wilson, that I was a red-headed man.'
001399 
001400 "'Why that?' I asks.
001401 
001402 "'Why,' says he, 'here's another vacancy on the League of the
001403 Red-headed Men. It's worth quite a little fortune to any man who
001404 gets it, and I understand that there are more vacancies than
001405 there are men, so that the trustees are at their wits' end what
001406 to do with the money. If my hair would only change colour, here's
001407 a nice little crib all ready for me to step into.'
001408 
001409 "'Why, what is it, then?' I asked. You see, Mr. Holmes, I am a
001410 very stay-at-home man, and as my business came to me instead of
001411 my having to go to it, I was often weeks on end without putting
001412 my foot over the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what
001413 was going on outside, and I was always glad of a bit of news.
001414 
001415 "'Have you never heard of the League of the Red-headed Men?' he
001416 asked with his eyes open.
001417 
001418 "'Never.'
001419 
001420 "'Why, I wonder at that, for you are eligible yourself for one
001421 of the vacancies.'
001422 
001423 "'And what are they worth?' I asked.
001424 
001425 "'Oh, merely a couple of hundred a year, but the work is slight,
001426 and it need not interfere very much with one's other
001427 occupations.'
001428 
001429 "Well, you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears,
001430 for the business has not been over-good for some years, and an
001431 extra couple of hundred would have been very handy.
001432 
001433 "'Tell me all about it,' said I.
001434 
001435 "'Well,' said he, showing me the advertisement, 'you can see for
001436 yourself that the League has a vacancy, and there is the address
001437 where you should apply for particulars. As far as I can make out,
001438 the League was founded by an American millionaire, Ezekiah
001439 Hopkins, who was very peculiar in his ways. He was himself
001440 red-headed, and he had a great sympathy for all red-headed men;
001441 so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous
001442 fortune in the hands of trustees, with instructions to apply the
001443 interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of
001444 that colour. From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to
001445 do.'
001446 
001447 "'But,' said I, 'there would be millions of red-headed men who
001448 would apply.'
001449 
001450 "'Not so many as you might think,' he answered. 'You see it is
001451 really confined to Londoners, and to grown men. This American had
001452 started from London when he was young, and he wanted to do the
001453 old town a good turn. Then, again, I have heard it is no use your
001454 applying if your hair is light red, or dark red, or anything but
001455 real bright, blazing, fiery red. Now, if you cared to apply, Mr.
001456 Wilson, you would just walk in; but perhaps it would hardly be
001457 worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a
001458 few hundred pounds.'
001459 
001460 "Now, it is a fact, gentlemen, as you may see for yourselves,
001461 that my hair is of a very full and rich tint, so that it seemed
001462 to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I
001463 stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met. Vincent
001464 Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might
001465 prove useful, so I just ordered him to put up the shutters for
001466 the day and to come right away with me. He was very willing to
001467 have a holiday, so we shut the business up and started off for
001468 the address that was given us in the advertisement.
001469 
001470 "I never hope to see such a sight as that again, Mr. Holmes. From
001471 north, south, east, and west every man who had a shade of red in
001472 his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement.
001473 Fleet Street was choked with red-headed folk, and Pope's Court
001474 looked like a coster's orange barrow. I should not have thought
001475 there were so many in the whole country as were brought together
001476 by that single advertisement. Every shade of colour they
001477 were--straw, lemon, orange, brick, Irish-setter, liver, clay;
001478 but, as Spaulding said, there were not many who had the real
001479 vivid flame-coloured tint. When I saw how many were waiting, I
001480 would have given it up in despair; but Spaulding would not hear
001481 of it. How he did it I could not imagine, but he pushed and
001482 pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd, and right up
001483 to the steps which led to the office. There was a double stream
001484 upon the stair, some going up in hope, and some coming back
001485 dejected; but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found
001486 ourselves in the office."
001487 
001488 "Your experience has been a most entertaining one," remarked
001489 Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge
001490 pinch of snuff. "Pray continue your very interesting statement."
001491 
001492 "There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs
001493 and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that
001494 was even redder than mine. He said a few words to each candidate
001495 as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in
001496 them which would disqualify them. Getting a vacancy did not seem
001497 to be such a very easy matter, after all. However, when our turn
001498 came the little man was much more favourable to me than to any of
001499 the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he
001500 might have a private word with us.
001501 
001502 "'This is Mr. Jabez Wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is
001503 willing to fill a vacancy in the League.'
001504 
001505 "'And he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'He has
001506 every requirement. I cannot recall when I have seen anything so
001507 fine.' He took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and
001508 gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful. Then suddenly he
001509 plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my
001510 success.
001511 
001512 "'It would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'You will,
001513 however, I am sure, excuse me for taking an obvious precaution.'
001514 With that he seized my hair in both his hands, and tugged until I
001515 yelled with the pain. 'There is water in your eyes,' said he as
001516 he released me. 'I perceive that all is as it should be. But we
001517 have to be careful, for we have twice been deceived by wigs and
001518 once by paint. I could tell you tales of cobbler's wax which
001519 would disgust you with human nature.' He stepped over to the
001520 window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the
001521 vacancy was filled. A groan of disappointment came up from below,
001522 and the folk all trooped away in different directions until there
001523 was not a red-head to be seen except my own and that of the
001524 manager.
001525 
001526 "'My name,' said he, 'is Mr. Duncan Ross, and I am myself one of
001527 the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor. Are
001528 you a married man, Mr. Wilson? Have you a family?'
001529 
001530 "I answered that I had not.
001531 
001532 "His face fell immediately.
001533 
001534 "'Dear me!' he said gravely, 'that is very serious indeed! I am
001535 sorry to hear you say that. The fund was, of course, for the
001536 propagation and spread of the red-heads as well as for their
001537 maintenance. It is exceedingly unfortunate that you should be a
001538 bachelor.'
001539 
001540 "My face lengthened at this, Mr. Holmes, for I thought that I was
001541 not to have the vacancy after all; but after thinking it over for
001542 a few minutes he said that it would be all right.
001543 
001544 "'In the case of another,' said he, 'the objection might be
001545 fatal, but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a
001546 head of hair as yours. When shall you be able to enter upon your
001547 new duties?'
001548 
001549 "'Well, it is a little awkward, for I have a business already,'
001550 said I.
001551 
001552 "'Oh, never mind about that, Mr. Wilson!' said Vincent Spaulding.
001553 'I should be able to look after that for you.'
001554 
001555 "'What would be the hours?' I asked.
001556 
001557 "'Ten to two.'
001558 
001559 "Now a pawnbroker's business is mostly done of an evening, Mr.
001560 Holmes, especially Thursday and Friday evening, which is just
001561 before pay-day; so it would suit me very well to earn a little in
001562 the mornings. Besides, I knew that my assistant was a good man,
001563 and that he would see to anything that turned up.
001564 
001565 "'That would suit me very well,' said I. 'And the pay?'
001566 
001567 "'Is 4 pounds a week.'
001568 
001569 "'And the work?'
001570 
001571 "'Is purely nominal.'
001572 
001573 "'What do you call purely nominal?'
001574 
001575 "'Well, you have to be in the office, or at least in the
001576 building, the whole time. If you leave, you forfeit your whole
001577 position forever. The will is very clear upon that point. You
001578 don't comply with the conditions if you budge from the office
001579 during that time.'
001580 
001581 "'It's only four hours a day, and I should not think of leaving,'
001582 said I.
001583 
001584 "'No excuse will avail,' said Mr. Duncan Ross; 'neither sickness
001585 nor business nor anything else. There you must stay, or you lose
001586 your billet.'
001587 
001588 "'And the work?'
001589 
001590 "'Is to copy out the "Encyclopaedia Britannica." There is the first
001591 volume of it in that press. You must find your own ink, pens, and
001592 blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. Will you be
001593 ready to-morrow?'
001594 
001595 "'Certainly,' I answered.
001596 
001597 "'Then, good-bye, Mr. Jabez Wilson, and let me congratulate you
001598 once more on the important position which you have been fortunate
001599 enough to gain.' He bowed me out of the room and I went home with
001600 my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, I was so pleased
001601 at my own good fortune.
001602 
001603 "Well, I thought over the matter all day, and by evening I was in
001604 low spirits again; for I had quite persuaded myself that the
001605 whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its
001606 object might be I could not imagine. It seemed altogether past
001607 belief that anyone could make such a will, or that they would pay
001608 such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the
001609 'Encyclopaedia Britannica.' Vincent Spaulding did what he could to
001610 cheer me up, but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the
001611 whole thing. However, in the morning I determined to have a look
001612 at it anyhow, so I bought a penny bottle of ink, and with a
001613 quill-pen, and seven sheets of foolscap paper, I started off for
001614 Pope's Court.
001615 
001616 "Well, to my surprise and delight, everything was as right as
001617 possible. The table was set out ready for me, and Mr. Duncan Ross
001618 was there to see that I got fairly to work. He started me off
001619 upon the letter A, and then he left me; but he would drop in from
001620 time to time to see that all was right with me. At two o'clock he
001621 bade me good-day, complimented me upon the amount that I had
001622 written, and locked the door of the office after me.
001623 
001624 "This went on day after day, Mr. Holmes, and on Saturday the
001625 manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my
001626 week's work. It was the same next week, and the same the week
001627 after. Every morning I was there at ten, and every afternoon I
001628 left at two. By degrees Mr. Duncan Ross took to coming in only
001629 once of a morning, and then, after a time, he did not come in at
001630 all. Still, of course, I never dared to leave the room for an
001631 instant, for I was not sure when he might come, and the billet
001632 was such a good one, and suited me so well, that I would not risk
001633 the loss of it.
001634 
001635 "Eight weeks passed away like this, and I had written about
001636 Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica, and
001637 hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B's before very
001638 long. It cost me something in foolscap, and I had pretty nearly
001639 filled a shelf with my writings. And then suddenly the whole
001640 business came to an end."
001641 
001642 "To an end?"
001643 
001644 "Yes, sir. And no later than this morning. I went to my work as
001645 usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a
001646 little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the
001647 panel with a tack. Here it is, and you can read for yourself."
001648 
001649 He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet
001650 of note-paper. It read in this fashion:
001651 
001652                   THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
001653 
001654                            IS
001655 
001656                         DISSOLVED.
001657 
001658                      October 9, 1890.
001659 
001660 Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the
001661 rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so
001662 completely overtopped every other consideration that we both
001663 burst out into a roar of laughter.
001664 
001665 "I cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our
001666 client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "If you can
001667 do nothing better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."
001668 
001669 "No, no," cried Holmes, shoving him back into the chair from
001670 which he had half risen. "I really wouldn't miss your case for
001671 the world. It is most refreshingly unusual. But there is, if you
001672 will excuse my saying so, something just a little funny about it.
001673 Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the
001674 door?"
001675 
001676 "I was staggered, sir. I did not know what to do. Then I called
001677 at the offices round, but none of them seemed to know anything
001678 about it. Finally, I went to the landlord, who is an accountant
001679 living on the ground-floor, and I asked him if he could tell me
001680 what had become of the Red-headed League. He said that he had
001681 never heard of any such body. Then I asked him who Mr. Duncan
001682 Ross was. He answered that the name was new to him.
001683 
001684 "'Well,' said I, 'the gentleman at No. 4.'
001685 
001686 "'What, the red-headed man?'
001687 
001688 "'Yes.'
001689 
001690 "'Oh,' said he, 'his name was William Morris. He was a solicitor
001691 and was using my room as a temporary convenience until his new
001692 premises were ready. He moved out yesterday.'
001693 
001694 "'Where could I find him?'
001695 
001696 "'Oh, at his new offices. He did tell me the address. Yes, 17
001697 King Edward Street, near St. Paul's.'
001698 
001699 "I started off, Mr. Holmes, but when I got to that address it was
001700 a manufactory of artificial knee-caps, and no one in it had ever
001701 heard of either Mr. William Morris or Mr. Duncan Ross."
001702 
001703 "And what did you do then?" asked Holmes.
001704 
001705 "I went home to Saxe-Coburg Square, and I took the advice of my
001706 assistant. But he could not help me in any way. He could only say
001707 that if I waited I should hear by post. But that was not quite
001708 good enough, Mr. Holmes. I did not wish to lose such a place
001709 without a struggle, so, as I had heard that you were good enough
001710 to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, I came right
001711 away to you."
001712 
001713 "And you did very wisely," said Holmes. "Your case is an
001714 exceedingly remarkable one, and I shall be happy to look into it.
001715 From what you have told me I think that it is possible that
001716 graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."
001717 
001718 "Grave enough!" said Mr. Jabez Wilson. "Why, I have lost four
001719 pound a week."
001720 
001721 "As far as you are personally concerned," remarked Holmes, "I do
001722 not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary
001723 league. On the contrary, you are, as I understand, richer by some
001724 30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have
001725 gained on every subject which comes under the letter A. You have
001726 lost nothing by them."
001727 
001728 "No, sir. But I want to find out about them, and who they are,
001729 and what their object was in playing this prank--if it was a
001730 prank--upon me. It was a pretty expensive joke for them, for it
001731 cost them two and thirty pounds."
001732 
001733 "We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you. And, first,
001734 one or two questions, Mr. Wilson. This assistant of yours who
001735 first called your attention to the advertisement--how long had he
001736 been with you?"
001737 
001738 "About a month then."
001739 
001740 "How did he come?"
001741 
001742 "In answer to an advertisement."
001743 
001744 "Was he the only applicant?"
001745 
001746 "No, I had a dozen."
001747 
001748 "Why did you pick him?"
001749 
001750 "Because he was handy and would come cheap."
001751 
001752 "At half-wages, in fact."
001753 
001754 "Yes."
001755 
001756 "What is he like, this Vincent Spaulding?"
001757 
001758 "Small, stout-built, very quick in his ways, no hair on his face,
001759 though he's not short of thirty. Has a white splash of acid upon
001760 his forehead."
001761 
001762 Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement. "I thought
001763 as much," said he. "Have you ever observed that his ears are
001764 pierced for earrings?"
001765 
001766 "Yes, sir. He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he
001767 was a lad."
001768 
001769 "Hum!" said Holmes, sinking back in deep thought. "He is still
001770 with you?"
001771 
001772 "Oh, yes, sir; I have only just left him."
001773 
001774 "And has your business been attended to in your absence?"
001775 
001776 "Nothing to complain of, sir. There's never very much to do of a
001777 morning."
001778 
001779 "That will do, Mr. Wilson. I shall be happy to give you an
001780 opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or two. To-day is
001781 Saturday, and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion."
001782 
001783 "Well, Watson," said Holmes when our visitor had left us, "what
001784 do you make of it all?"
001785 
001786 "I make nothing of it," I answered frankly. "It is a most
001787 mysterious business."
001788 
001789 "As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less
001790 mysterious it proves to be. It is your commonplace, featureless
001791 crimes which are really puzzling, just as a commonplace face is
001792 the most difficult to identify. But I must be prompt over this
001793 matter."
001794 
001795 "What are you going to do, then?" I asked.
001796 
001797 "To smoke," he answered. "It is quite a three pipe problem, and I
001798 beg that you won't speak to me for fifty minutes." He curled
001799 himself up in his chair, with his thin knees drawn up to his
001800 hawk-like nose, and there he sat with his eyes closed and his
001801 black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird.
001802 I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep, and
001803 indeed was nodding myself, when he suddenly sprang out of his
001804 chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put
001805 his pipe down upon the mantelpiece.
001806 
001807 "Sarasate plays at the St. James's Hall this afternoon," he
001808 remarked. "What do you think, Watson? Could your patients spare
001809 you for a few hours?"
001810 
001811 "I have nothing to do to-day. My practice is never very
001812 absorbing."
001813 
001814 "Then put on your hat and come. I am going through the City
001815 first, and we can have some lunch on the way. I observe that
001816 there is a good deal of German music on the programme, which is
001817 rather more to my taste than Italian or French. It is
001818 introspective, and I want to introspect. Come along!"
001819 
001820 We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate; and a short
001821 walk took us to Saxe-Coburg Square, the scene of the singular
001822 story which we had listened to in the morning. It was a poky,
001823 little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy
001824 two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in
001825 enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded
001826 laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and
001827 uncongenial atmosphere. Three gilt balls and a brown board with
001828 "JABEZ WILSON" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced
001829 the place where our red-headed client carried on his business.
001830 Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side
001831 and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between
001832 puckered lids. Then he walked slowly up the street, and then down
001833 again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. Finally
001834 he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously
001835 upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up
001836 to the door and knocked. It was instantly opened by a
001837 bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step
001838 in.
001839 
001840 "Thank you," said Holmes, "I only wished to ask you how you would
001841 go from here to the Strand."
001842 
001843 "Third right, fourth left," answered the assistant promptly,
001844 closing the door.
001845 
001846 "Smart fellow, that," observed Holmes as we walked away. "He is,
001847 in my judgment, the fourth smartest man in London, and for daring
001848 I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third. I have known
001849 something of him before."
001850 
001851 "Evidently," said I, "Mr. Wilson's assistant counts for a good
001852 deal in this mystery of the Red-headed League. I am sure that you
001853 inquired your way merely in order that you might see him."
001854 
001855 "Not him."
001856 
001857 "What then?"
001858 
001859 "The knees of his trousers."
001860 
001861 "And what did you see?"
001862 
001863 "What I expected to see."
001864 
001865 "Why did you beat the pavement?"
001866 
001867 "My dear doctor, this is a time for observation, not for talk. We
001868 are spies in an enemy's country. We know something of Saxe-Coburg
001869 Square. Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it."
001870 
001871 The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the
001872 corner from the retired Saxe-Coburg Square presented as great a
001873 contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back. It was
001874 one of the main arteries which conveyed the traffic of the City
001875 to the north and west. The roadway was blocked with the immense
001876 stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward,
001877 while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm of
001878 pedestrians. It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line
001879 of fine shops and stately business premises that they really
001880 abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square
001881 which we had just quitted.
001882 
001883 "Let me see," said Holmes, standing at the corner and glancing
001884 along the line, "I should like just to remember the order of the
001885 houses here. It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of
001886 London. There is Mortimer's, the tobacconist, the little
001887 newspaper shop, the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank,
001888 the Vegetarian Restaurant, and McFarlane's carriage-building
001889 depot. That carries us right on to the other block. And now,
001890 Doctor, we've done our work, so it's time we had some play. A
001891 sandwich and a cup of coffee, and then off to violin-land, where
001892 all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony, and there are no
001893 red-headed clients to vex us with their conundrums."
001894 
001895 My friend was an enthusiastic musician, being himself not only a
001896 very capable performer but a composer of no ordinary merit. All
001897 the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect
001898 happiness, gently waving his long, thin fingers in time to the
001899 music, while his gently smiling face and his languid, dreamy eyes
001900 were as unlike those of Holmes the sleuth-hound, Holmes the
001901 relentless, keen-witted, ready-handed criminal agent, as it was
001902 possible to conceive. In his singular character the dual nature
001903 alternately asserted itself, and his extreme exactness and
001904 astuteness represented, as I have often thought, the reaction
001905 against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally
001906 predominated in him. The swing of his nature took him from
001907 extreme languor to devouring energy; and, as I knew well, he was
001908 never so truly formidable as when, for days on end, he had been
001909 lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his
001910 black-letter editions. Then it was that the lust of the chase
001911 would suddenly come upon him, and that his brilliant reasoning
001912 power would rise to the level of intuition, until those who were
001913 unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a
001914 man whose knowledge was not that of other mortals. When I saw him
001915 that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St. James's Hall I
001916 felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set
001917 himself to hunt down.
001918 
001919 "You want to go home, no doubt, Doctor," he remarked as we
001920 emerged.
001921 
001922 "Yes, it would be as well."
001923 
001924 "And I have some business to do which will take some hours. This
001925 business at Coburg Square is serious."
001926 
001927 "Why serious?"
001928 
001929 "A considerable crime is in contemplation. I have every reason to
001930 believe that we shall be in time to stop it. But to-day being
001931 Saturday rather complicates matters. I shall want your help
001932 to-night."
001933 
001934 "At what time?"
001935 
001936 "Ten will be early enough."
001937 
001938 "I shall be at Baker Street at ten."
001939 
001940 "Very well. And, I say, Doctor, there may be some little danger,
001941 so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." He waved his
001942 hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the
001943 crowd.
001944 
001945 I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours, but I was
001946 always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings
001947 with Sherlock Holmes. Here I had heard what he had heard, I had
001948 seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that
001949 he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to
001950 happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and
001951 grotesque. As I drove home to my house in Kensington I thought
001952 over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed
001953 copier of the "Encyclopaedia" down to the visit to Saxe-Coburg
001954 Square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me.
001955 What was this nocturnal expedition, and why should I go armed?
001956 Where were we going, and what were we to do? I had the hint from
001957 Holmes that this smooth-faced pawnbroker's assistant was a
001958 formidable man--a man who might play a deep game. I tried to
001959 puzzle it out, but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside
001960 until night should bring an explanation.
001961 
001962 It was a quarter-past nine when I started from home and made my
001963 way across the Park, and so through Oxford Street to Baker
001964 Street. Two hansoms were standing at the door, and as I entered
001965 the passage I heard the sound of voices from above. On entering
001966 his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men,
001967 one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones, the official police
001968 agent, while the other was a long, thin, sad-faced man, with a
001969 very shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock-coat.
001970 
001971 "Ha! Our party is complete," said Holmes, buttoning up his
001972 pea-jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack.
001973 "Watson, I think you know Mr. Jones, of Scotland Yard? Let me
001974 introduce you to Mr. Merryweather, who is to be our companion in
001975 to-night's adventure."
001976 
001977 "We're hunting in couples again, Doctor, you see," said Jones in
001978 his consequential way. "Our friend here is a wonderful man for
001979 starting a chase. All he wants is an old dog to help him to do
001980 the running down."
001981 
001982 "I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase,"
001983 observed Mr. Merryweather gloomily.
001984 
001985 "You may place considerable confidence in Mr. Holmes, sir," said
001986 the police agent loftily. "He has his own little methods, which
001987 are, if he won't mind my saying so, just a little too theoretical
001988 and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. It
001989 is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of
001990 the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure, he has been more nearly
001991 correct than the official force."
001992 
001993 "Oh, if you say so, Mr. Jones, it is all right," said the
001994 stranger with deference. "Still, I confess that I miss my rubber.
001995 It is the first Saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that I
001996 have not had my rubber."
001997 
001998 "I think you will find," said Sherlock Holmes, "that you will
001999 play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and
002000 that the play will be more exciting. For you, Mr. Merryweather,
002001 the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, Jones, it will
002002 be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."
002003 
002004 "John Clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. He's a
002005 young man, Mr. Merryweather, but he is at the head of his
002006 profession, and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on
002007 any criminal in London. He's a remarkable man, is young John
002008 Clay. His grandfather was a royal duke, and he himself has been
002009 to Eton and Oxford. His brain is as cunning as his fingers, and
002010 though we meet signs of him at every turn, we never know where to
002011 find the man himself. He'll crack a crib in Scotland one week,
002012 and be raising money to build an orphanage in Cornwall the next.
002013 I've been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him
002014 yet."
002015 
002016 "I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night.
002017 I've had one or two little turns also with Mr. John Clay, and I
002018 agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. It is
002019 past ten, however, and quite time that we started. If you two
002020 will take the first hansom, Watson and I will follow in the
002021 second."
002022 
002023 Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive
002024 and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in
002025 the afternoon. We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit
002026 streets until we emerged into Farrington Street.
002027 
002028 "We are close there now," my friend remarked. "This fellow
002029 Merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the
002030 matter. I thought it as well to have Jones with us also. He is
002031 not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession.
002032 He has one positive virtue. He is as brave as a bulldog and as
002033 tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone. Here we
002034 are, and they are waiting for us."
002035 
002036 We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had
002037 found ourselves in the morning. Our cabs were dismissed, and,
002038 following the guidance of Mr. Merryweather, we passed down a
002039 narrow passage and through a side door, which he opened for us.
002040 Within there was a small corridor, which ended in a very massive
002041 iron gate. This also was opened, and led down a flight of winding
002042 stone steps, which terminated at another formidable gate. Mr.
002043 Merryweather stopped to light a lantern, and then conducted us
002044 down a dark, earth-smelling passage, and so, after opening a
002045 third door, into a huge vault or cellar, which was piled all
002046 round with crates and massive boxes.
002047 
002048 "You are not very vulnerable from above," Holmes remarked as he
002049 held up the lantern and gazed about him.
002050 
002051 "Nor from below," said Mr. Merryweather, striking his stick upon
002052 the flags which lined the floor. "Why, dear me, it sounds quite
002053 hollow!" he remarked, looking up in surprise.
002054 
002055 "I must really ask you to be a little more quiet!" said Holmes
002056 severely. "You have already imperilled the whole success of our
002057 expedition. Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit
002058 down upon one of those boxes, and not to interfere?"
002059 
002060 The solemn Mr. Merryweather perched himself upon a crate, with a
002061 very injured expression upon his face, while Holmes fell upon his
002062 knees upon the floor and, with the lantern and a magnifying lens,
002063 began to examine minutely the cracks between the stones. A few
002064 seconds sufficed to satisfy him, for he sprang to his feet again
002065 and put his glass in his pocket.
002066 
002067 "We have at least an hour before us," he remarked, "for they can
002068 hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed.
002069 Then they will not lose a minute, for the sooner they do their
002070 work the longer time they will have for their escape. We are at
002071 present, Doctor--as no doubt you have divined--in the cellar of
002072 the City branch of one of the principal London banks. Mr.
002073 Merryweather is the chairman of directors, and he will explain to
002074 you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of
002075 London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at
002076 present."
002077 
002078 "It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had
002079 several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."
002080 
002081 "Your French gold?"
002082 
002083 "Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources
002084 and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of
002085 France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to
002086 unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The
002087 crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between
002088 layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at
002089 present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the
002090 directors have had misgivings upon the subject."
002091 
002092 "Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is
002093 time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an
002094 hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr.
002095 Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."
002096 
002097 "And sit in the dark?"
002098 
002099 "I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and
002100 I thought that, as we were a partie carre, you might have your
002101 rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have
002102 gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And,
002103 first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men,
002104 and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us
002105 some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate,
002106 and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a
002107 light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no
002108 compunction about shooting them down."
002109 
002110 I placed my revolver, cocked, upon the top of the wooden case
002111 behind which I crouched. Holmes shot the slide across the front
002112 of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness--such an absolute
002113 darkness as I have never before experienced. The smell of hot
002114 metal remained to assure us that the light was still there, ready
002115 to flash out at a moment's notice. To me, with my nerves worked
002116 up to a pitch of expectancy, there was something depressing and
002117 subduing in the sudden gloom, and in the cold dank air of the
002118 vault.
002119 
002120 "They have but one retreat," whispered Holmes. "That is back
002121 through the house into Saxe-Coburg Square. I hope that you have
002122 done what I asked you, Jones?"
002123 
002124 "I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door."
002125 
002126 "Then we have stopped all the holes. And now we must be silent
002127 and wait."
002128 
002129 What a time it seemed! From comparing notes afterwards it was but
002130 an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must
002131 have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs
002132 were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my
002133 nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my
002134 hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle
002135 breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper,
002136 heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note
002137 of the bank director. From my position I could look over the case
002138 in the direction of the floor. Suddenly my eyes caught the glint
002139 of a light.
002140 
002141 At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement. Then
002142 it lengthened out until it became a yellow line, and then,
002143 without any warning or sound, a gash seemed to open and a hand
002144 appeared, a white, almost womanly hand, which felt about in the
002145 centre of the little area of light. For a minute or more the
002146 hand, with its writhing fingers, protruded out of the floor. Then
002147 it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared, and all was dark
002148 again save the single lurid spark which marked a chink between
002149 the stones.
002150 
002151 Its disappearance, however, was but momentary. With a rending,
002152 tearing sound, one of the broad, white stones turned over upon
002153 its side and left a square, gaping hole, through which streamed
002154 the light of a lantern. Over the edge there peeped a clean-cut,
002155 boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand
002156 on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and
002157 waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. In another
002158 instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after
002159 him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face
002160 and a shock of very red hair.
002161 
002162 "It's all clear," he whispered. "Have you the chisel and the
002163 bags? Great Scott! Jump, Archie, jump, and I'll swing for it!"
002164 
002165 Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the
002166 collar. The other dived down the hole, and I heard the sound of
002167 rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts. The light flashed
002168 upon the barrel of a revolver, but Holmes' hunting crop came
002169 down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone
002170 floor.
002171 
002172 "It's no use, John Clay," said Holmes blandly. "You have no
002173 chance at all."
002174 
002175 "So I see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "I fancy
002176 that my pal is all right, though I see you have got his
002177 coat-tails."
002178 
002179 "There are three men waiting for him at the door," said Holmes.
002180 
002181 "Oh, indeed! You seem to have done the thing very completely. I
002182 must compliment you."
002183 
002184 "And I you," Holmes answered. "Your red-headed idea was very new
002185 and effective."
002186 
002187 "You'll see your pal again presently," said Jones. "He's quicker
002188 at climbing down holes than I am. Just hold out while I fix the
002189 derbies."
002190 
002191 "I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands,"
002192 remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists.
002193 "You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins. Have
002194 the goodness, also, when you address me always to say 'sir' and
002195 'please.'"
002196 
002197 "All right," said Jones with a stare and a snigger. "Well, would
002198 you please, sir, march upstairs, where we can get a cab to carry
002199 your Highness to the police-station?"
002200 
002201 "That is better," said John Clay serenely. He made a sweeping bow
002202 to the three of us and walked quietly off in the custody of the
002203 detective.
002204 
002205 "Really, Mr. Holmes," said Mr. Merryweather as we followed them
002206 from the cellar, "I do not know how the bank can thank you or
002207 repay you. There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated
002208 in the most complete manner one of the most determined attempts
002209 at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience."
002210 
002211 "I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr.
002212 John Clay," said Holmes. "I have been at some small expense over
002213 this matter, which I shall expect the bank to refund, but beyond
002214 that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in
002215 many ways unique, and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of
002216 the Red-headed League."
002217 
002218 
002219 "You see, Watson," he explained in the early hours of the morning
002220 as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda in Baker Street, "it
002221 was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible
002222 object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of
002223 the League, and the copying of the 'Encyclopaedia,' must be to get
002224 this not over-bright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of
002225 hours every day. It was a curious way of managing it, but,
002226 really, it would be difficult to suggest a better. The method was
002227 no doubt suggested to Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his
002228 accomplice's hair. The 4 pounds a week was a lure which must draw
002229 him, and what was it to them, who were playing for thousands?
002230 They put in the advertisement, one rogue has the temporary
002231 office, the other rogue incites the man to apply for it, and
002232 together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the
002233 week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for
002234 half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive
002235 for securing the situation."
002236 
002237 "But how could you guess what the motive was?"
002238 
002239 "Had there been women in the house, I should have suspected a
002240 mere vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The
002241 man's business was a small one, and there was nothing in his
002242 house which could account for such elaborate preparations, and
002243 such an expenditure as they were at. It must, then, be something
002244 out of the house. What could it be? I thought of the assistant's
002245 fondness for photography, and his trick of vanishing into the
002246 cellar. The cellar! There was the end of this tangled clue. Then
002247 I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant and found that I
002248 had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in
002249 London. He was doing something in the cellar--something which
002250 took many hours a day for months on end. What could it be, once
002251 more? I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel
002252 to some other building.
002253 
002254 "So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action. I
002255 surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick. I was
002256 ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind.
002257 It was not in front. Then I rang the bell, and, as I hoped, the
002258 assistant answered it. We have had some skirmishes, but we had
002259 never set eyes upon each other before. I hardly looked at his
002260 face. His knees were what I wished to see. You must yourself have
002261 remarked how worn, wrinkled, and stained they were. They spoke of
002262 those hours of burrowing. The only remaining point was what they
002263 were burrowing for. I walked round the corner, saw the City and
002264 Suburban Bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that I
002265 had solved my problem. When you drove home after the concert I
002266 called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank
002267 directors, with the result that you have seen."
002268 
002269 "And how could you tell that they would make their attempt
002270 to-night?" I asked.
002271 
002272 "Well, when they closed their League offices that was a sign that
002273 they cared no longer about Mr. Jabez Wilson's presence--in other
002274 words, that they had completed their tunnel. But it was essential
002275 that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the
002276 bullion might be removed. Saturday would suit them better than
002277 any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape.
002278 For all these reasons I expected them to come to-night."
002279 
002280 "You reasoned it out beautifully," I exclaimed in unfeigned
002281 admiration. "It is so long a chain, and yet every link rings
002282 true."
002283 
002284 "It saved me from ennui," he answered, yawning. "Alas! I already
002285 feel it closing in upon me. My life is spent in one long effort
002286 to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little
002287 problems help me to do so."
002288 
002289 "And you are a benefactor of the race," said I.
002290 
002291 He shrugged his shoulders. "Well, perhaps, after all, it is of
002292 some little use," he remarked. "'L'homme c'est rien--l'oeuvre
002293 c'est tout,' as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand."
002294 
002295 
002296 
002297 ADVENTURE III. A CASE OF IDENTITY
002298 
002299 "My dear fellow," said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side
002300 of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street, "life is infinitely
002301 stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We
002302 would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere
002303 commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window
002304 hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the
002305 roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the
002306 strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the
002307 wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and
002308 leading to the most outr results, it would make all fiction with
002309 its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and
002310 unprofitable."
002311 
002312 "And yet I am not convinced of it," I answered. "The cases which
002313 come to light in the papers are, as a rule, bald enough, and
002314 vulgar enough. We have in our police reports realism pushed to
002315 its extreme limits, and yet the result is, it must be confessed,
002316 neither fascinating nor artistic."
002317 
002318 "A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a
002319 realistic effect," remarked Holmes. "This is wanting in the
002320 police report, where more stress is laid, perhaps, upon the
002321 platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details, which to an
002322 observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter. Depend
002323 upon it, there is nothing so unnatural as the commonplace."
002324 
002325 I smiled and shook my head. "I can quite understand your thinking
002326 so," I said. "Of course, in your position of unofficial adviser
002327 and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled, throughout
002328 three continents, you are brought in contact with all that is
002329 strange and bizarre. But here"--I picked up the morning paper
002330 from the ground--"let us put it to a practical test. Here is the
002331 first heading upon which I come. 'A husband's cruelty to his
002332 wife.' There is half a column of print, but I know without
002333 reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me. There is, of
002334 course, the other woman, the drink, the push, the blow, the
002335 bruise, the sympathetic sister or landlady. The crudest of
002336 writers could invent nothing more crude."
002337 
002338 "Indeed, your example is an unfortunate one for your argument,"
002339 said Holmes, taking the paper and glancing his eye down it. "This
002340 is the Dundas separation case, and, as it happens, I was engaged
002341 in clearing up some small points in connection with it. The
002342 husband was a teetotaler, there was no other woman, and the
002343 conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of
002344 winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and hurling
002345 them at his wife, which, you will allow, is not an action likely
002346 to occur to the imagination of the average story-teller. Take a
002347 pinch of snuff, Doctor, and acknowledge that I have scored over
002348 you in your example."
002349 
002350 He held out his snuffbox of old gold, with a great amethyst in
002351 the centre of the lid. Its splendour was in such contrast to his
002352 homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon
002353 it.
002354 
002355 "Ah," said he, "I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks.
002356 It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my
002357 assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers."
002358 
002359 "And the ring?" I asked, glancing at a remarkable brilliant which
002360 sparkled upon his finger.
002361 
002362 "It was from the reigning family of Holland, though the matter in
002363 which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it
002364 even to you, who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of
002365 my little problems."
002366 
002367 "And have you any on hand just now?" I asked with interest.
002368 
002369 "Some ten or twelve, but none which present any feature of
002370 interest. They are important, you understand, without being
002371 interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in
002372 unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation,
002373 and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the
002374 charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the
002375 simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is
002376 the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter
002377 which has been referred to me from Marseilles, there is nothing
002378 which presents any features of interest. It is possible, however,
002379 that I may have something better before very many minutes are
002380 over, for this is one of my clients, or I am much mistaken."
002381 
002382 He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted
002383 blinds gazing down into the dull neutral-tinted London street.
002384 Looking over his shoulder, I saw that on the pavement opposite
002385 there stood a large woman with a heavy fur boa round her neck,
002386 and a large curling red feather in a broad-brimmed hat which was
002387 tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her
002388 ear. From under this great panoply she peeped up in a nervous,
002389 hesitating fashion at our windows, while her body oscillated
002390 backward and forward, and her fingers fidgeted with her glove
002391 buttons. Suddenly, with a plunge, as of the swimmer who leaves
002392 the bank, she hurried across the road, and we heard the sharp
002393 clang of the bell.
002394 
002395 "I have seen those symptoms before," said Holmes, throwing his
002396 cigarette into the fire. "Oscillation upon the pavement always
002397 means an affaire de coeur. She would like advice, but is not sure
002398 that the matter is not too delicate for communication. And yet
002399 even here we may discriminate. When a woman has been seriously
002400 wronged by a man she no longer oscillates, and the usual symptom
002401 is a broken bell wire. Here we may take it that there is a love
002402 matter, but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed, or
002403 grieved. But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts."
002404 
002405 As he spoke there was a tap at the door, and the boy in buttons
002406 entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland, while the lady herself
002407 loomed behind his small black figure like a full-sailed
002408 merchant-man behind a tiny pilot boat. Sherlock Holmes welcomed
002409 her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable, and,
002410 having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair, he looked
002411 her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was
002412 peculiar to him.
002413 
002414 "Do you not find," he said, "that with your short sight it is a
002415 little trying to do so much typewriting?"
002416 
002417 "I did at first," she answered, "but now I know where the letters
002418 are without looking." Then, suddenly realising the full purport
002419 of his words, she gave a violent start and looked up, with fear
002420 and astonishment upon her broad, good-humoured face. "You've
002421 heard about me, Mr. Holmes," she cried, "else how could you know
002422 all that?"
002423 
002424 "Never mind," said Holmes, laughing; "it is my business to know
002425 things. Perhaps I have trained myself to see what others
002426 overlook. If not, why should you come to consult me?"
002427 
002428 "I came to you, sir, because I heard of you from Mrs. Etherege,
002429 whose husband you found so easy when the police and everyone had
002430 given him up for dead. Oh, Mr. Holmes, I wish you would do as
002431 much for me. I'm not rich, but still I have a hundred a year in
002432 my own right, besides the little that I make by the machine, and
002433 I would give it all to know what has become of Mr. Hosmer Angel."
002434 
002435 "Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry?" asked
002436 Sherlock Holmes, with his finger-tips together and his eyes to
002437 the ceiling.
002438 
002439 Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss
002440 Mary Sutherland. "Yes, I did bang out of the house," she said,
002441 "for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr.
002442 Windibank--that is, my father--took it all. He would not go to
002443 the police, and he would not go to you, and so at last, as he
002444 would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done,
002445 it made me mad, and I just on with my things and came right away
002446 to you."
002447 
002448 "Your father," said Holmes, "your stepfather, surely, since the
002449 name is different."
002450 
002451 "Yes, my stepfather. I call him father, though it sounds funny,
002452 too, for he is only five years and two months older than myself."
002453 
002454 "And your mother is alive?"
002455 
002456 "Oh, yes, mother is alive and well. I wasn't best pleased, Mr.
002457 Holmes, when she married again so soon after father's death, and
002458 a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself. Father
002459 was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road, and he left a tidy
002460 business behind him, which mother carried on with Mr. Hardy, the
002461 foreman; but when Mr. Windibank came he made her sell the
002462 business, for he was very superior, being a traveller in wines.
002463 They got 4700 pounds for the goodwill and interest, which wasn't
002464 near as much as father could have got if he had been alive."
002465 
002466 I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this
002467 rambling and inconsequential narrative, but, on the contrary, he
002468 had listened with the greatest concentration of attention.
002469 
002470 "Your own little income," he asked, "does it come out of the
002471 business?"
002472 
002473 "Oh, no, sir. It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle
002474 Ned in Auckland. It is in New Zealand stock, paying 4 1/2 per
002475 cent. Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount, but I can
002476 only touch the interest."
002477 
002478 "You interest me extremely," said Holmes. "And since you draw so
002479 large a sum as a hundred a year, with what you earn into the
002480 bargain, you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in
002481 every way. I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely
002482 upon an income of about 60 pounds."
002483 
002484 "I could do with much less than that, Mr. Holmes, but you
002485 understand that as long as I live at home I don't wish to be a
002486 burden to them, and so they have the use of the money just while
002487 I am staying with them. Of course, that is only just for the
002488 time. Mr. Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it
002489 over to mother, and I find that I can do pretty well with what I
002490 earn at typewriting. It brings me twopence a sheet, and I can
002491 often do from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day."
002492 
002493 "You have made your position very clear to me," said Holmes.
002494 "This is my friend, Dr. Watson, before whom you can speak as
002495 freely as before myself. Kindly tell us now all about your
002496 connection with Mr. Hosmer Angel."
002497 
002498 A flush stole over Miss Sutherland's face, and she picked
002499 nervously at the fringe of her jacket. "I met him first at the
002500 gasfitters' ball," she said. "They used to send father tickets
002501 when he was alive, and then afterwards they remembered us, and
002502 sent them to mother. Mr. Windibank did not wish us to go. He
002503 never did wish us to go anywhere. He would get quite mad if I
002504 wanted so much as to join a Sunday-school treat. But this time I
002505 was set on going, and I would go; for what right had he to
002506 prevent? He said the folk were not fit for us to know, when all
002507 father's friends were to be there. And he said that I had nothing
002508 fit to wear, when I had my purple plush that I had never so much
002509 as taken out of the drawer. At last, when nothing else would do,
002510 he went off to France upon the business of the firm, but we went,
002511 mother and I, with Mr. Hardy, who used to be our foreman, and it
002512 was there I met Mr. Hosmer Angel."
002513 
002514 "I suppose," said Holmes, "that when Mr. Windibank came back from
002515 France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball."
002516 
002517 "Oh, well, he was very good about it. He laughed, I remember, and
002518 shrugged his shoulders, and said there was no use denying
002519 anything to a woman, for she would have her way."
002520 
002521 "I see. Then at the gasfitters' ball you met, as I understand, a
002522 gentleman called Mr. Hosmer Angel."
002523 
002524 "Yes, sir. I met him that night, and he called next day to ask if
002525 we had got home all safe, and after that we met him--that is to
002526 say, Mr. Holmes, I met him twice for walks, but after that father
002527 came back again, and Mr. Hosmer Angel could not come to the house
002528 any more."
002529 
002530 "No?"
002531 
002532 "Well, you know father didn't like anything of the sort. He
002533 wouldn't have any visitors if he could help it, and he used to
002534 say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle. But
002535 then, as I used to say to mother, a woman wants her own circle to
002536 begin with, and I had not got mine yet."
002537 
002538 "But how about Mr. Hosmer Angel? Did he make no attempt to see
002539 you?"
002540 
002541 "Well, father was going off to France again in a week, and Hosmer
002542 wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each
002543 other until he had gone. We could write in the meantime, and he
002544 used to write every day. I took the letters in in the morning, so
002545 there was no need for father to know."
002546 
002547 "Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time?"
002548 
002549 "Oh, yes, Mr. Holmes. We were engaged after the first walk that
002550 we took. Hosmer--Mr. Angel--was a cashier in an office in
002551 Leadenhall Street--and--"
002552 
002553 "What office?"
002554 
002555 "That's the worst of it, Mr. Holmes, I don't know."
002556 
002557 "Where did he live, then?"
002558 
002559 "He slept on the premises."
002560 
002561 "And you don't know his address?"
002562 
002563 "No--except that it was Leadenhall Street."
002564 
002565 "Where did you address your letters, then?"
002566 
002567 "To the Leadenhall Street Post Office, to be left till called
002568 for. He said that if they were sent to the office he would be
002569 chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady,
002570 so I offered to typewrite them, like he did his, but he wouldn't
002571 have that, for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come
002572 from me, but when they were typewritten he always felt that the
002573 machine had come between us. That will just show you how fond he
002574 was of me, Mr. Holmes, and the little things that he would think
002575 of."
002576 
002577 "It was most suggestive," said Holmes. "It has long been an axiom
002578 of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important.
002579 Can you remember any other little things about Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
002580 
002581 "He was a very shy man, Mr. Holmes. He would rather walk with me
002582 in the evening than in the daylight, for he said that he hated to
002583 be conspicuous. Very retiring and gentlemanly he was. Even his
002584 voice was gentle. He'd had the quinsy and swollen glands when he
002585 was young, he told me, and it had left him with a weak throat,
002586 and a hesitating, whispering fashion of speech. He was always
002587 well dressed, very neat and plain, but his eyes were weak, just
002588 as mine are, and he wore tinted glasses against the glare."
002589 
002590 "Well, and what happened when Mr. Windibank, your stepfather,
002591 returned to France?"
002592 
002593 "Mr. Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we
002594 should marry before father came back. He was in dreadful earnest
002595 and made me swear, with my hands on the Testament, that whatever
002596 happened I would always be true to him. Mother said he was quite
002597 right to make me swear, and that it was a sign of his passion.
002598 Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder
002599 of him than I was. Then, when they talked of marrying within the
002600 week, I began to ask about father; but they both said never to
002601 mind about father, but just to tell him afterwards, and mother
002602 said she would make it all right with him. I didn't quite like
002603 that, Mr. Holmes. It seemed funny that I should ask his leave, as
002604 he was only a few years older than me; but I didn't want to do
002605 anything on the sly, so I wrote to father at Bordeaux, where the
002606 company has its French offices, but the letter came back to me on
002607 the very morning of the wedding."
002608 
002609 "It missed him, then?"
002610 
002611 "Yes, sir; for he had started to England just before it arrived."
002612 
002613 "Ha! that was unfortunate. Your wedding was arranged, then, for
002614 the Friday. Was it to be in church?"
002615 
002616 "Yes, sir, but very quietly. It was to be at St. Saviour's, near
002617 King's Cross, and we were to have breakfast afterwards at the St.
002618 Pancras Hotel. Hosmer came for us in a hansom, but as there were
002619 two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a
002620 four-wheeler, which happened to be the only other cab in the
002621 street. We got to the church first, and when the four-wheeler
002622 drove up we waited for him to step out, but he never did, and
002623 when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one
002624 there! The cabman said that he could not imagine what had become
002625 of him, for he had seen him get in with his own eyes. That was
002626 last Friday, Mr. Holmes, and I have never seen or heard anything
002627 since then to throw any light upon what became of him."
002628 
002629 "It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated," said
002630 Holmes.
002631 
002632 "Oh, no, sir! He was too good and kind to leave me so. Why, all
002633 the morning he was saying to me that, whatever happened, I was to
002634 be true; and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to
002635 separate us, I was always to remember that I was pledged to him,
002636 and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later. It seemed
002637 strange talk for a wedding-morning, but what has happened since
002638 gives a meaning to it."
002639 
002640 "Most certainly it does. Your own opinion is, then, that some
002641 unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him?"
002642 
002643 "Yes, sir. I believe that he foresaw some danger, or else he
002644 would not have talked so. And then I think that what he foresaw
002645 happened."
002646 
002647 "But you have no notion as to what it could have been?"
002648 
002649 "None."
002650 
002651 "One more question. How did your mother take the matter?"
002652 
002653 "She was angry, and said that I was never to speak of the matter
002654 again."
002655 
002656 "And your father? Did you tell him?"
002657 
002658 "Yes; and he seemed to think, with me, that something had
002659 happened, and that I should hear of Hosmer again. As he said,
002660 what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of
002661 the church, and then leaving me? Now, if he had borrowed my
002662 money, or if he had married me and got my money settled on him,
002663 there might be some reason, but Hosmer was very independent about
002664 money and never would look at a shilling of mine. And yet, what
002665 could have happened? And why could he not write? Oh, it drives me
002666 half-mad to think of it, and I can't sleep a wink at night." She
002667 pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob
002668 heavily into it.
002669 
002670 "I shall glance into the case for you," said Holmes, rising, "and
002671 I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result. Let the
002672 weight of the matter rest upon me now, and do not let your mind
002673 dwell upon it further. Above all, try to let Mr. Hosmer Angel
002674 vanish from your memory, as he has done from your life."
002675 
002676 "Then you don't think I'll see him again?"
002677 
002678 "I fear not."
002679 
002680 "Then what has happened to him?"
002681 
002682 "You will leave that question in my hands. I should like an
002683 accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can
002684 spare."
002685 
002686 "I advertised for him in last Saturday's Chronicle," said she.
002687 "Here is the slip and here are four letters from him."
002688 
002689 "Thank you. And your address?"
002690 
002691 "No. 31 Lyon Place, Camberwell."
002692 
002693 "Mr. Angel's address you never had, I understand. Where is your
002694 father's place of business?"
002695 
002696 "He travels for Westhouse & Marbank, the great claret importers
002697 of Fenchurch Street."
002698 
002699 "Thank you. You have made your statement very clearly. You will
002700 leave the papers here, and remember the advice which I have given
002701 you. Let the whole incident be a sealed book, and do not allow it
002702 to affect your life."
002703 
002704 "You are very kind, Mr. Holmes, but I cannot do that. I shall be
002705 true to Hosmer. He shall find me ready when he comes back."
002706 
002707 For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face, there was
002708 something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which
002709 compelled our respect. She laid her little bundle of papers upon
002710 the table and went her way, with a promise to come again whenever
002711 she might be summoned.
002712 
002713 Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips
002714 still pressed together, his legs stretched out in front of him,
002715 and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling. Then he took down
002716 from the rack the old and oily clay pipe, which was to him as a
002717 counsellor, and, having lit it, he leaned back in his chair, with
002718 the thick blue cloud-wreaths spinning up from him, and a look of
002719 infinite languor in his face.
002720 
002721 "Quite an interesting study, that maiden," he observed. "I found
002722 her more interesting than her little problem, which, by the way,
002723 is rather a trite one. You will find parallel cases, if you
002724 consult my index, in Andover in '77, and there was something of
002725 the sort at The Hague last year. Old as is the idea, however,
002726 there were one or two details which were new to me. But the
002727 maiden herself was most instructive."
002728 
002729 "You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite
002730 invisible to me," I remarked.
002731 
002732 "Not invisible but unnoticed, Watson. You did not know where to
002733 look, and so you missed all that was important. I can never bring
002734 you to realise the importance of sleeves, the suggestiveness of
002735 thumb-nails, or the great issues that may hang from a boot-lace.
002736 Now, what did you gather from that woman's appearance? Describe
002737 it."
002738 
002739 "Well, she had a slate-coloured, broad-brimmed straw hat, with a
002740 feather of a brickish red. Her jacket was black, with black beads
002741 sewn upon it, and a fringe of little black jet ornaments. Her
002742 dress was brown, rather darker than coffee colour, with a little
002743 purple plush at the neck and sleeves. Her gloves were greyish and
002744 were worn through at the right forefinger. Her boots I didn't
002745 observe. She had small round, hanging gold earrings, and a
002746 general air of being fairly well-to-do in a vulgar, comfortable,
002747 easy-going way."
002748 
002749 Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled.
002750 
002751 "'Pon my word, Watson, you are coming along wonderfully. You have
002752 really done very well indeed. It is true that you have missed
002753 everything of importance, but you have hit upon the method, and
002754 you have a quick eye for colour. Never trust to general
002755 impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details. My
002756 first glance is always at a woman's sleeve. In a man it is
002757 perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser. As you
002758 observe, this woman had plush upon her sleeves, which is a most
002759 useful material for showing traces. The double line a little
002760 above the wrist, where the typewritist presses against the table,
002761 was beautifully defined. The sewing-machine, of the hand type,
002762 leaves a similar mark, but only on the left arm, and on the side
002763 of it farthest from the thumb, instead of being right across the
002764 broadest part, as this was. I then glanced at her face, and,
002765 observing the dint of a pince-nez at either side of her nose, I
002766 ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting, which seemed
002767 to surprise her."
002768 
002769 "It surprised me."
002770 
002771 "But, surely, it was obvious. I was then much surprised and
002772 interested on glancing down to observe that, though the boots
002773 which she was wearing were not unlike each other, they were
002774 really odd ones; the one having a slightly decorated toe-cap, and
002775 the other a plain one. One was buttoned only in the two lower
002776 buttons out of five, and the other at the first, third, and
002777 fifth. Now, when you see that a young lady, otherwise neatly
002778 dressed, has come away from home with odd boots, half-buttoned,
002779 it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a hurry."
002780 
002781 "And what else?" I asked, keenly interested, as I always was, by
002782 my friend's incisive reasoning.
002783 
002784 "I noted, in passing, that she had written a note before leaving
002785 home but after being fully dressed. You observed that her right
002786 glove was torn at the forefinger, but you did not apparently see
002787 that both glove and finger were stained with violet ink. She had
002788 written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep. It must have been
002789 this morning, or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger.
002790 All this is amusing, though rather elementary, but I must go back
002791 to business, Watson. Would you mind reading me the advertised
002792 description of Mr. Hosmer Angel?"
002793 
002794 I held the little printed slip to the light.
002795 
002796 "Missing," it said, "on the morning of the fourteenth, a gentleman
002797 named Hosmer Angel. About five ft. seven in. in height;
002798 strongly built, sallow complexion, black hair, a little bald in
002799 the centre, bushy, black side-whiskers and moustache; tinted
002800 glasses, slight infirmity of speech. Was dressed, when last seen,
002801 in black frock-coat faced with silk, black waistcoat, gold Albert
002802 chain, and grey Harris tweed trousers, with brown gaiters over
002803 elastic-sided boots. Known to have been employed in an office in
002804 Leadenhall Street. Anybody bringing--"
002805 
002806 "That will do," said Holmes. "As to the letters," he continued,
002807 glancing over them, "they are very commonplace. Absolutely no
002808 clue in them to Mr. Angel, save that he quotes Balzac once. There
002809 is one remarkable point, however, which will no doubt strike
002810 you."
002811 
002812 "They are typewritten," I remarked.
002813 
002814 "Not only that, but the signature is typewritten. Look at the
002815 neat little 'Hosmer Angel' at the bottom. There is a date, you
002816 see, but no superscription except Leadenhall Street, which is
002817 rather vague. The point about the signature is very suggestive--in
002818 fact, we may call it conclusive."
002819 
002820 "Of what?"
002821 
002822 "My dear fellow, is it possible you do not see how strongly it
002823 bears upon the case?"
002824 
002825 "I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able
002826 to deny his signature if an action for breach of promise were
002827 instituted."
002828 
002829 "No, that was not the point. However, I shall write two letters,
002830 which should settle the matter. One is to a firm in the City, the
002831 other is to the young lady's stepfather, Mr. Windibank, asking
002832 him whether he could meet us here at six o'clock tomorrow
002833 evening. It is just as well that we should do business with the
002834 male relatives. And now, Doctor, we can do nothing until the
002835 answers to those letters come, so we may put our little problem
002836 upon the shelf for the interim."
002837 
002838 I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend's subtle powers
002839 of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that
002840 he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy
002841 demeanour with which he treated the singular mystery which he had
002842 been called upon to fathom. Once only had I known him to fail, in
002843 the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler
002844 photograph; but when I looked back to the weird business of the
002845 Sign of Four, and the extraordinary circumstances connected with
002846 the Study in Scarlet, I felt that it would be a strange tangle
002847 indeed which he could not unravel.
002848 
002849 I left him then, still puffing at his black clay pipe, with the
002850 conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would
002851 find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up
002852 to the identity of the disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary
002853 Sutherland.
002854 
002855 A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own
002856 attention at the time, and the whole of next day I was busy at
002857 the bedside of the sufferer. It was not until close upon six
002858 o'clock that I found myself free and was able to spring into a
002859 hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I might be too
002860 late to assist at the dnouement of the little mystery. I found
002861 Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, thin
002862 form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. A formidable
002863 array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent cleanly smell
002864 of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his day in the
002865 chemical work which was so dear to him.
002866 
002867 "Well, have you solved it?" I asked as I entered.
002868 
002869 "Yes. It was the bisulphate of baryta."
002870 
002871 "No, no, the mystery!" I cried.
002872 
002873 "Oh, that! I thought of the salt that I have been working upon.
002874 There was never any mystery in the matter, though, as I said
002875 yesterday, some of the details are of interest. The only drawback
002876 is that there is no law, I fear, that can touch the scoundrel."
002877 
002878 "Who was he, then, and what was his object in deserting Miss
002879 Sutherland?"
002880 
002881 The question was hardly out of my mouth, and Holmes had not yet
002882 opened his lips to reply, when we heard a heavy footfall in the
002883 passage and a tap at the door.
002884 
002885 "This is the girl's stepfather, Mr. James Windibank," said
002886 Holmes. "He has written to me to say that he would be here at
002887 six. Come in!"
002888 
002889 The man who entered was a sturdy, middle-sized fellow, some
002890 thirty years of age, clean-shaven, and sallow-skinned, with a
002891 bland, insinuating manner, and a pair of wonderfully sharp and
002892 penetrating grey eyes. He shot a questioning glance at each of
002893 us, placed his shiny top-hat upon the sideboard, and with a
002894 slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair.
002895 
002896 "Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that
002897 this typewritten letter is from you, in which you made an
002898 appointment with me for six o'clock?"
002899 
002900 "Yes, sir. I am afraid that I am a little late, but I am not
002901 quite my own master, you know. I am sorry that Miss Sutherland
002902 has troubled you about this little matter, for I think it is far
002903 better not to wash linen of the sort in public. It was quite
002904 against my wishes that she came, but she is a very excitable,
002905 impulsive girl, as you may have noticed, and she is not easily
002906 controlled when she has made up her mind on a point. Of course, I
002907 did not mind you so much, as you are not connected with the
002908 official police, but it is not pleasant to have a family
002909 misfortune like this noised abroad. Besides, it is a useless
002910 expense, for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel?"
002911 
002912 "On the contrary," said Holmes quietly; "I have every reason to
002913 believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr. Hosmer Angel."
002914 
002915 Mr. Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves. "I am
002916 delighted to hear it," he said.
002917 
002918 "It is a curious thing," remarked Holmes, "that a typewriter has
002919 really quite as much individuality as a man's handwriting. Unless
002920 they are quite new, no two of them write exactly alike. Some
002921 letters get more worn than others, and some wear only on one
002922 side. Now, you remark in this note of yours, Mr. Windibank, that
002923 in every case there is some little slurring over of the 'e,' and
002924 a slight defect in the tail of the 'r.' There are fourteen other
002925 characteristics, but those are the more obvious."
002926 
002927 "We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office,
002928 and no doubt it is a little worn," our visitor answered, glancing
002929 keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes.
002930 
002931 "And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study,
002932 Mr. Windibank," Holmes continued. "I think of writing another
002933 little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its
002934 relation to crime. It is a subject to which I have devoted some
002935 little attention. I have here four letters which purport to come
002936 from the missing man. They are all typewritten. In each case, not
002937 only are the 'e's' slurred and the 'r's' tailless, but you will
002938 observe, if you care to use my magnifying lens, that the fourteen
002939 other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well."
002940 
002941 Mr. Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat. "I
002942 cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk, Mr. Holmes,"
002943 he said. "If you can catch the man, catch him, and let me know
002944 when you have done it."
002945 
002946 "Certainly," said Holmes, stepping over and turning the key in
002947 the door. "I let you know, then, that I have caught him!"
002948 
002949 "What! where?" shouted Mr. Windibank, turning white to his lips
002950 and glancing about him like a rat in a trap.
002951 
002952 "Oh, it won't do--really it won't," said Holmes suavely. "There
002953 is no possible getting out of it, Mr. Windibank. It is quite too
002954 transparent, and it was a very bad compliment when you said that
002955 it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question. That's
002956 right! Sit down and let us talk it over."
002957 
002958 Our visitor collapsed into a chair, with a ghastly face and a
002959 glitter of moisture on his brow. "It--it's not actionable," he
002960 stammered.
002961 
002962 "I am very much afraid that it is not. But between ourselves,
002963 Windibank, it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a
002964 petty way as ever came before me. Now, let me just run over the
002965 course of events, and you will contradict me if I go wrong."
002966 
002967 The man sat huddled up in his chair, with his head sunk upon his
002968 breast, like one who is utterly crushed. Holmes stuck his feet up
002969 on the corner of the mantelpiece and, leaning back with his hands
002970 in his pockets, began talking, rather to himself, as it seemed,
002971 than to us.
002972 
002973 "The man married a woman very much older than himself for her
002974 money," said he, "and he enjoyed the use of the money of the
002975 daughter as long as she lived with them. It was a considerable
002976 sum, for people in their position, and the loss of it would have
002977 made a serious difference. It was worth an effort to preserve it.
002978 The daughter was of a good, amiable disposition, but affectionate
002979 and warm-hearted in her ways, so that it was evident that with
002980 her fair personal advantages, and her little income, she would
002981 not be allowed to remain single long. Now her marriage would
002982 mean, of course, the loss of a hundred a year, so what does her
002983 stepfather do to prevent it? He takes the obvious course of
002984 keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of
002985 people of her own age. But soon he found that that would not
002986 answer forever. She became restive, insisted upon her rights, and
002987 finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain
002988 ball. What does her clever stepfather do then? He conceives an
002989 idea more creditable to his head than to his heart. With the
002990 connivance and assistance of his wife he disguised himself,
002991 covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses, masked the face with
002992 a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers, sunk that clear voice
002993 into an insinuating whisper, and doubly secure on account of the
002994 girl's short sight, he appears as Mr. Hosmer Angel, and keeps off
002995 other lovers by making love himself."
002996 
002997 "It was only a joke at first," groaned our visitor. "We never
002998 thought that she would have been so carried away."
002999 
003000 "Very likely not. However that may be, the young lady was very
003001 decidedly carried away, and, having quite made up her mind that
003002 her stepfather was in France, the suspicion of treachery never
003003 for an instant entered her mind. She was flattered by the
003004 gentleman's attentions, and the effect was increased by the
003005 loudly expressed admiration of her mother. Then Mr. Angel began
003006 to call, for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as
003007 far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced. There
003008 were meetings, and an engagement, which would finally secure the
003009 girl's affections from turning towards anyone else. But the
003010 deception could not be kept up forever. These pretended journeys
003011 to France were rather cumbrous. The thing to do was clearly to
003012 bring the business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it
003013 would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady's mind and
003014 prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to
003015 come. Hence those vows of fidelity exacted upon a Testament, and
003016 hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening
003017 on the very morning of the wedding. James Windibank wished Miss
003018 Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel, and so uncertain as to
003019 his fate, that for ten years to come, at any rate, she would not
003020 listen to another man. As far as the church door he brought her,
003021 and then, as he could go no farther, he conveniently vanished
003022 away by the old trick of stepping in at one door of a
003023 four-wheeler and out at the other. I think that was the chain of
003024 events, Mr. Windibank!"
003025 
003026 Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes
003027 had been talking, and he rose from his chair now with a cold
003028 sneer upon his pale face.
003029 
003030 "It may be so, or it may not, Mr. Holmes," said he, "but if you
003031 are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is
003032 you who are breaking the law now, and not me. I have done nothing
003033 actionable from the first, but as long as you keep that door
003034 locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal
003035 constraint."
003036 
003037 "The law cannot, as you say, touch you," said Holmes, unlocking
003038 and throwing open the door, "yet there never was a man who
003039 deserved punishment more. If the young lady has a brother or a
003040 friend, he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders. By Jove!"
003041 he continued, flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon
003042 the man's face, "it is not part of my duties to my client, but
003043 here's a hunting crop handy, and I think I shall just treat
003044 myself to--" He took two swift steps to the whip, but before he
003045 could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs,
003046 the heavy hall door banged, and from the window we could see Mr.
003047 James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road.
003048 
003049 "There's a cold-blooded scoundrel!" said Holmes, laughing, as he
003050 threw himself down into his chair once more. "That fellow will
003051 rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad, and
003052 ends on a gallows. The case has, in some respects, been not
003053 entirely devoid of interest."
003054 
003055 "I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning," I
003056 remarked.
003057 
003058 "Well, of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr.
003059 Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious
003060 conduct, and it was equally clear that the only man who really
003061 profited by the incident, as far as we could see, was the
003062 stepfather. Then the fact that the two men were never together,
003063 but that the one always appeared when the other was away, was
003064 suggestive. So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice,
003065 which both hinted at a disguise, as did the bushy whiskers. My
003066 suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in
003067 typewriting his signature, which, of course, inferred that his
003068 handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise even
003069 the smallest sample of it. You see all these isolated facts,
003070 together with many minor ones, all pointed in the same
003071 direction."
003072 
003073 "And how did you verify them?"
003074 
003075 "Having once spotted my man, it was easy to get corroboration. I
003076 knew the firm for which this man worked. Having taken the printed
003077 description. I eliminated everything from it which could be the
003078 result of a disguise--the whiskers, the glasses, the voice, and I
003079 sent it to the firm, with a request that they would inform me
003080 whether it answered to the description of any of their
003081 travellers. I had already noticed the peculiarities of the
003082 typewriter, and I wrote to the man himself at his business
003083 address asking him if he would come here. As I expected, his
003084 reply was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but
003085 characteristic defects. The same post brought me a letter from
003086 Westhouse & Marbank, of Fenchurch Street, to say that the
003087 description tallied in every respect with that of their employ,
003088 James Windibank. Voil tout!"
003089 
003090 "And Miss Sutherland?"
003091 
003092 "If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old
003093 Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger
003094 cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.'
003095 There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much
003096 knowledge of the world."
003097 
003098 
003099 
003100 ADVENTURE IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
003101 
003102 We were seated at breakfast one morning, my wife and I, when the
003103 maid brought in a telegram. It was from Sherlock Holmes and ran
003104 in this way:
003105 
003106 "Have you a couple of days to spare? Have just been wired for from
003107 the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy.
003108 Shall be glad if you will come with me. Air and scenery perfect.
003109 Leave Paddington by the 11:15."
003110 
003111 "What do you say, dear?" said my wife, looking across at me.
003112 "Will you go?"
003113 
003114 "I really don't know what to say. I have a fairly long list at
003115 present."
003116 
003117 "Oh, Anstruther would do your work for you. You have been looking
003118 a little pale lately. I think that the change would do you good,
003119 and you are always so interested in Mr. Sherlock Holmes' cases."
003120 
003121 "I should be ungrateful if I were not, seeing what I gained
003122 through one of them," I answered. "But if I am to go, I must pack
003123 at once, for I have only half an hour."
003124 
003125 My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the
003126 effect of making me a prompt and ready traveller. My wants were
003127 few and simple, so that in less than the time stated I was in a
003128 cab with my valise, rattling away to Paddington Station. Sherlock
003129 Holmes was pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt
003130 figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey
003131 travelling-cloak and close-fitting cloth cap.
003132 
003133 "It is really very good of you to come, Watson," said he. "It
003134 makes a considerable difference to me, having someone with me on
003135 whom I can thoroughly rely. Local aid is always either worthless
003136 or else biassed. If you will keep the two corner seats I shall
003137 get the tickets."
003138 
003139 We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of
003140 papers which Holmes had brought with him. Among these he rummaged
003141 and read, with intervals of note-taking and of meditation, until
003142 we were past Reading. Then he suddenly rolled them all into a
003143 gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack.
003144 
003145 "Have you heard anything of the case?" he asked.
003146 
003147 "Not a word. I have not seen a paper for some days."
003148 
003149 "The London press has not had very full accounts. I have just
003150 been looking through all the recent papers in order to master the
003151 particulars. It seems, from what I gather, to be one of those
003152 simple cases which are so extremely difficult."
003153 
003154 "That sounds a little paradoxical."
003155 
003156 "But it is profoundly true. Singularity is almost invariably a
003157 clue. The more featureless and commonplace a crime is, the more
003158 difficult it is to bring it home. In this case, however, they
003159 have established a very serious case against the son of the
003160 murdered man."
003161 
003162 "It is a murder, then?"
003163 
003164 "Well, it is conjectured to be so. I shall take nothing for
003165 granted until I have the opportunity of looking personally into
003166 it. I will explain the state of things to you, as far as I have
003167 been able to understand it, in a very few words.
003168 
003169 "Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross, in
003170 Herefordshire. The largest landed proprietor in that part is a
003171 Mr. John Turner, who made his money in Australia and returned
003172 some years ago to the old country. One of the farms which he
003173 held, that of Hatherley, was let to Mr. Charles McCarthy, who was
003174 also an ex-Australian. The men had known each other in the
003175 colonies, so that it was not unnatural that when they came to
003176 settle down they should do so as near each other as possible.
003177 Turner was apparently the richer man, so McCarthy became his
003178 tenant but still remained, it seems, upon terms of perfect
003179 equality, as they were frequently together. McCarthy had one son,
003180 a lad of eighteen, and Turner had an only daughter of the same
003181 age, but neither of them had wives living. They appear to have
003182 avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to
003183 have led retired lives, though both the McCarthys were fond of
003184 sport and were frequently seen at the race-meetings of the
003185 neighbourhood. McCarthy kept two servants--a man and a girl.
003186 Turner had a considerable household, some half-dozen at the
003187 least. That is as much as I have been able to gather about the
003188 families. Now for the facts.
003189 
003190 "On June 3rd, that is, on Monday last, McCarthy left his house at
003191 Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the
003192 Boscombe Pool, which is a small lake formed by the spreading out
003193 of the stream which runs down the Boscombe Valley. He had been
003194 out with his serving-man in the morning at Ross, and he had told
003195 the man that he must hurry, as he had an appointment of
003196 importance to keep at three. From that appointment he never came
003197 back alive.
003198 
003199 "From Hatherley Farm-house to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a
003200 mile, and two people saw him as he passed over this ground. One
003201 was an old woman, whose name is not mentioned, and the other was
003202 William Crowder, a game-keeper in the employ of Mr. Turner. Both
003203 these witnesses depose that Mr. McCarthy was walking alone. The
003204 game-keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr.
003205 McCarthy pass he had seen his son, Mr. James McCarthy, going the
003206 same way with a gun under his arm. To the best of his belief, the
003207 father was actually in sight at the time, and the son was
003208 following him. He thought no more of the matter until he heard in
003209 the evening of the tragedy that had occurred.
003210 
003211 "The two McCarthys were seen after the time when William Crowder,
003212 the game-keeper, lost sight of them. The Boscombe Pool is thickly
003213 wooded round, with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the
003214 edge. A girl of fourteen, Patience Moran, who is the daughter of
003215 the lodge-keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate, was in one of the
003216 woods picking flowers. She states that while she was there she
003217 saw, at the border of the wood and close by the lake, Mr.
003218 McCarthy and his son, and that they appeared to be having a
003219 violent quarrel. She heard Mr. McCarthy the elder using very
003220 strong language to his son, and she saw the latter raise up his
003221 hand as if to strike his father. She was so frightened by their
003222 violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached
003223 home that she had left the two McCarthys quarrelling near
003224 Boscombe Pool, and that she was afraid that they were going to
003225 fight. She had hardly said the words when young Mr. McCarthy came
003226 running up to the lodge to say that he had found his father dead
003227 in the wood, and to ask for the help of the lodge-keeper. He was
003228 much excited, without either his gun or his hat, and his right
003229 hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood. On
003230 following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the
003231 grass beside the pool. The head had been beaten in by repeated
003232 blows of some heavy and blunt weapon. The injuries were such as
003233 might very well have been inflicted by the butt-end of his son's
003234 gun, which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the
003235 body. Under these circumstances the young man was instantly
003236 arrested, and a verdict of 'wilful murder' having been returned
003237 at the inquest on Tuesday, he was on Wednesday brought before the
003238 magistrates at Ross, who have referred the case to the next
003239 Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as they came out
003240 before the coroner and the police-court."
003241 
003242 "I could hardly imagine a more damning case," I remarked. "If
003243 ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so
003244 here."
003245 
003246 "Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing," answered Holmes
003247 thoughtfully. "It may seem to point very straight to one thing,
003248 but if you shift your own point of view a little, you may find it
003249 pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something
003250 entirely different. It must be confessed, however, that the case
003251 looks exceedingly grave against the young man, and it is very
003252 possible that he is indeed the culprit. There are several people
003253 in the neighbourhood, however, and among them Miss Turner, the
003254 daughter of the neighbouring landowner, who believe in his
003255 innocence, and who have retained Lestrade, whom you may recollect
003256 in connection with the Study in Scarlet, to work out the case in
003257 his interest. Lestrade, being rather puzzled, has referred the
003258 case to me, and hence it is that two middle-aged gentlemen are
003259 flying westward at fifty miles an hour instead of quietly
003260 digesting their breakfasts at home."
003261 
003262 "I am afraid," said I, "that the facts are so obvious that you
003263 will find little credit to be gained out of this case."
003264 
003265 "There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact," he
003266 answered, laughing. "Besides, we may chance to hit upon some
003267 other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to
003268 Mr. Lestrade. You know me too well to think that I am boasting
003269 when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by
003270 means which he is quite incapable of employing, or even of
003271 understanding. To take the first example to hand, I very clearly
003272 perceive that in your bedroom the window is upon the right-hand
003273 side, and yet I question whether Mr. Lestrade would have noted
003274 even so self-evident a thing as that."
003275 
003276 "How on earth--"
003277 
003278 "My dear fellow, I know you well. I know the military neatness
003279 which characterises you. You shave every morning, and in this
003280 season you shave by the sunlight; but since your shaving is less
003281 and less complete as we get farther back on the left side, until
003282 it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the
003283 jaw, it is surely very clear that that side is less illuminated
003284 than the other. I could not imagine a man of your habits looking
003285 at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a
003286 result. I only quote this as a trivial example of observation and
003287 inference. Therein lies my mtier, and it is just possible that
003288 it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before
003289 us. There are one or two minor points which were brought out in
003290 the inquest, and which are worth considering."
003291 
003292 "What are they?"
003293 
003294 "It appears that his arrest did not take place at once, but after
003295 the return to Hatherley Farm. On the inspector of constabulary
003296 informing him that he was a prisoner, he remarked that he was not
003297 surprised to hear it, and that it was no more than his deserts.
003298 This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any
003299 traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the
003300 coroner's jury."
003301 
003302 "It was a confession," I ejaculated.
003303 
003304 "No, for it was followed by a protestation of innocence."
003305 
003306 "Coming on the top of such a damning series of events, it was at
003307 least a most suspicious remark."
003308 
003309 "On the contrary," said Holmes, "it is the brightest rift which I
003310 can at present see in the clouds. However innocent he might be,
003311 he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the
003312 circumstances were very black against him. Had he appeared
003313 surprised at his own arrest, or feigned indignation at it, I
003314 should have looked upon it as highly suspicious, because such
003315 surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances,
003316 and yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man. His
003317 frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent
003318 man, or else as a man of considerable self-restraint and
003319 firmness. As to his remark about his deserts, it was also not
003320 unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of
003321 his father, and that there is no doubt that he had that very day
003322 so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him, and
003323 even, according to the little girl whose evidence is so
003324 important, to raise his hand as if to strike him. The
003325 self-reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark
003326 appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a
003327 guilty one."
003328 
003329 I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter
003330 evidence," I remarked.
003331 
003332 "So they have. And many men have been wrongfully hanged."
003333 
003334 "What is the young man's own account of the matter?"
003335 
003336 "It is, I am afraid, not very encouraging to his supporters,
003337 though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive.
003338 You will find it here, and may read it for yourself."
003339 
003340 He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire
003341 paper, and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the
003342 paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own
003343 statement of what had occurred. I settled myself down in the
003344 corner of the carriage and read it very carefully. It ran in this
003345 way:
003346 
003347 "Mr. James McCarthy, the only son of the deceased, was then called
003348 and gave evidence as follows: 'I had been away from home for
003349 three days at Bristol, and had only just returned upon the
003350 morning of last Monday, the 3rd. My father was absent from home at
003351 the time of my arrival, and I was informed by the maid that he
003352 had driven over to Ross with John Cobb, the groom. Shortly after
003353 my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard, and,
003354 looking out of my window, I saw him get out and walk rapidly out
003355 of the yard, though I was not aware in which direction he was
003356 going. I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of
003357 the Boscombe Pool, with the intention of visiting the rabbit
003358 warren which is upon the other side. On my way I saw William
003359 Crowder, the game-keeper, as he had stated in his evidence; but
003360 he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father. I had
003361 no idea that he was in front of me. When about a hundred yards
003362 from the pool I heard a cry of "Cooee!" which was a usual signal
003363 between my father and myself. I then hurried forward, and found
003364 him standing by the pool. He appeared to be much surprised at
003365 seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there. A
003366 conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows,
003367 for my father was a man of a very violent temper. Seeing that his
003368 passion was becoming ungovernable, I left him and returned
003369 towards Hatherley Farm. I had not gone more than 150 yards,
003370 however, when I heard a hideous outcry behind me, which caused me
003371 to run back again. I found my father expiring upon the ground,
003372 with his head terribly injured. I dropped my gun and held him in
003373 my arms, but he almost instantly expired. I knelt beside him for
003374 some minutes, and then made my way to Mr. Turner's lodge-keeper,
003375 his house being the nearest, to ask for assistance. I saw no one
003376 near my father when I returned, and I have no idea how he came by
003377 his injuries. He was not a popular man, being somewhat cold and
003378 forbidding in his manners, but he had, as far as I know, no
003379 active enemies. I know nothing further of the matter.'
003380 
003381 "The Coroner: Did your father make any statement to you before
003382 he died?
003383 
003384 "Witness: He mumbled a few words, but I could only catch some
003385 allusion to a rat.
003386 
003387 "The Coroner: What did you understand by that?
003388 
003389 "Witness: It conveyed no meaning to me. I thought that he was
003390 delirious.
003391 
003392 "The Coroner: What was the point upon which you and your father
003393 had this final quarrel?
003394 
003395 "Witness: I should prefer not to answer.
003396 
003397 "The Coroner: I am afraid that I must press it.
003398 
003399 "Witness: It is really impossible for me to tell you. I can
003400 assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which
003401 followed.
003402 
003403 "The Coroner: That is for the court to decide. I need not point
003404 out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case
003405 considerably in any future proceedings which may arise.
003406 
003407 "Witness: I must still refuse.
003408 
003409 "The Coroner: I understand that the cry of 'Cooee' was a common
003410 signal between you and your father?
003411 
003412 "Witness: It was.
003413 
003414 "The Coroner: How was it, then, that he uttered it before he saw
003415 you, and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol?
003416 
003417 "Witness (with considerable confusion): I do not know.
003418 
003419 "A Juryman: Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions
003420 when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father
003421 fatally injured?
003422 
003423 "Witness: Nothing definite.
003424 
003425 "The Coroner: What do you mean?
003426 
003427 "Witness: I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into
003428 the open, that I could think of nothing except of my father. Yet
003429 I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay
003430 upon the ground to the left of me. It seemed to me to be
003431 something grey in colour, a coat of some sort, or a plaid perhaps.
003432 When I rose from my father I looked round for it, but it was
003433 gone.
003434 
003435 "'Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help?'
003436 
003437 "'Yes, it was gone.'
003438 
003439 "'You cannot say what it was?'
003440 
003441 "'No, I had a feeling something was there.'
003442 
003443 "'How far from the body?'
003444 
003445 "'A dozen yards or so.'
003446 
003447 "'And how far from the edge of the wood?'
003448 
003449 "'About the same.'
003450 
003451 "'Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen
003452 yards of it?'
003453 
003454 "'Yes, but with my back towards it.'
003455 
003456 "This concluded the examination of the witness."
003457 
003458 "I see," said I as I glanced down the column, "that the coroner
003459 in his concluding remarks was rather severe upon young McCarthy.
003460 He calls attention, and with reason, to the discrepancy about his
003461 father having signalled to him before seeing him, also to his
003462 refusal to give details of his conversation with his father, and
003463 his singular account of his father's dying words. They are all,
003464 as he remarks, very much against the son."
003465 
003466 Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon
003467 the cushioned seat. "Both you and the coroner have been at some
003468 pains," said he, "to single out the very strongest points in the
003469 young man's favour. Don't you see that you alternately give him
003470 credit for having too much imagination and too little? Too
003471 little, if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would
003472 give him the sympathy of the jury; too much, if he evolved from
003473 his own inner consciousness anything so outr as a dying
003474 reference to a rat, and the incident of the vanishing cloth. No,
003475 sir, I shall approach this case from the point of view that what
003476 this young man says is true, and we shall see whither that
003477 hypothesis will lead us. And now here is my pocket Petrarch, and
003478 not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the
003479 scene of action. We lunch at Swindon, and I see that we shall be
003480 there in twenty minutes."
003481 
003482 It was nearly four o'clock when we at last, after passing through
003483 the beautiful Stroud Valley, and over the broad gleaming Severn,
003484 found ourselves at the pretty little country-town of Ross. A
003485 lean, ferret-like man, furtive and sly-looking, was waiting for
003486 us upon the platform. In spite of the light brown dustcoat and
003487 leather-leggings which he wore in deference to his rustic
003488 surroundings, I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade, of
003489 Scotland Yard. With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a
003490 room had already been engaged for us.
003491 
003492 "I have ordered a carriage," said Lestrade as we sat over a cup
003493 of tea. "I knew your energetic nature, and that you would not be
003494 happy until you had been on the scene of the crime."
003495 
003496 "It was very nice and complimentary of you," Holmes answered. "It
003497 is entirely a question of barometric pressure."
003498 
003499 Lestrade looked startled. "I do not quite follow," he said.
003500 
003501 "How is the glass? Twenty-nine, I see. No wind, and not a cloud
003502 in the sky. I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need
003503 smoking, and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country
003504 hotel abomination. I do not think that it is probable that I
003505 shall use the carriage to-night."
003506 
003507 Lestrade laughed indulgently. "You have, no doubt, already formed
003508 your conclusions from the newspapers," he said. "The case is as
003509 plain as a pikestaff, and the more one goes into it the plainer
003510 it becomes. Still, of course, one can't refuse a lady, and such a
003511 very positive one, too. She has heard of you, and would have your
003512 opinion, though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing
003513 which you could do which I had not already done. Why, bless my
003514 soul! here is her carriage at the door."
003515 
003516 He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the
003517 most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life. Her
003518 violet eyes shining, her lips parted, a pink flush upon her
003519 cheeks, all thought of her natural reserve lost in her
003520 overpowering excitement and concern.
003521 
003522 "Oh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes!" she cried, glancing from one to the
003523 other of us, and finally, with a woman's quick intuition,
003524 fastening upon my companion, "I am so glad that you have come. I
003525 have driven down to tell you so. I know that James didn't do it.
003526 I know it, and I want you to start upon your work knowing it,
003527 too. Never let yourself doubt upon that point. We have known each
003528 other since we were little children, and I know his faults as no
003529 one else does; but he is too tender-hearted to hurt a fly. Such a
003530 charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him."
003531 
003532 "I hope we may clear him, Miss Turner," said Sherlock Holmes.
003533 "You may rely upon my doing all that I can."
003534 
003535 "But you have read the evidence. You have formed some conclusion?
003536 Do you not see some loophole, some flaw? Do you not yourself
003537 think that he is innocent?"
003538 
003539 "I think that it is very probable."
003540 
003541 "There, now!" she cried, throwing back her head and looking
003542 defiantly at Lestrade. "You hear! He gives me hopes."
003543 
003544 Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am afraid that my colleague
003545 has been a little quick in forming his conclusions," he said.
003546 
003547 "But he is right. Oh! I know that he is right. James never did
003548 it. And about his quarrel with his father, I am sure that the
003549 reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because
003550 I was concerned in it."
003551 
003552 "In what way?" asked Holmes.
003553 
003554 "It is no time for me to hide anything. James and his father had
003555 many disagreements about me. Mr. McCarthy was very anxious that
003556 there should be a marriage between us. James and I have always
003557 loved each other as brother and sister; but of course he is young
003558 and has seen very little of life yet, and--and--well, he
003559 naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet. So there
003560 were quarrels, and this, I am sure, was one of them."
003561 
003562 "And your father?" asked Holmes. "Was he in favour of such a
003563 union?"
003564 
003565 "No, he was averse to it also. No one but Mr. McCarthy was in
003566 favour of it." A quick blush passed over her fresh young face as
003567 Holmes shot one of his keen, questioning glances at her.
003568 
003569 "Thank you for this information," said he. "May I see your father
003570 if I call to-morrow?"
003571 
003572 "I am afraid the doctor won't allow it."
003573 
003574 "The doctor?"
003575 
003576 "Yes, have you not heard? Poor father has never been strong for
003577 years back, but this has broken him down completely. He has taken
003578 to his bed, and Dr. Willows says that he is a wreck and that his
003579 nervous system is shattered. Mr. McCarthy was the only man alive
003580 who had known dad in the old days in Victoria."
003581 
003582 "Ha! In Victoria! That is important."
003583 
003584 "Yes, at the mines."
003585 
003586 "Quite so; at the gold-mines, where, as I understand, Mr. Turner
003587 made his money."
003588 
003589 "Yes, certainly."
003590 
003591 "Thank you, Miss Turner. You have been of material assistance to
003592 me."
003593 
003594 "You will tell me if you have any news to-morrow. No doubt you
003595 will go to the prison to see James. Oh, if you do, Mr. Holmes, do
003596 tell him that I know him to be innocent."
003597 
003598 "I will, Miss Turner."
003599 
003600 "I must go home now, for dad is very ill, and he misses me so if
003601 I leave him. Good-bye, and God help you in your undertaking." She
003602 hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered, and we
003603 heard the wheels of her carriage rattle off down the street.
003604 
003605 "I am ashamed of you, Holmes," said Lestrade with dignity after a
003606 few minutes' silence. "Why should you raise up hopes which you
003607 are bound to disappoint? I am not over-tender of heart, but I
003608 call it cruel."
003609 
003610 "I think that I see my way to clearing James McCarthy," said
003611 Holmes. "Have you an order to see him in prison?"
003612 
003613 "Yes, but only for you and me."
003614 
003615 "Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out. We have
003616 still time to take a train to Hereford and see him to-night?"
003617 
003618 "Ample."
003619 
003620 "Then let us do so. Watson, I fear that you will find it very
003621 slow, but I shall only be away a couple of hours."
003622 
003623 I walked down to the station with them, and then wandered through
003624 the streets of the little town, finally returning to the hotel,
003625 where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a
003626 yellow-backed novel. The puny plot of the story was so thin,
003627 however, when compared to the deep mystery through which we were
003628 groping, and I found my attention wander so continually from the
003629 action to the fact, that I at last flung it across the room and
003630 gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the
003631 day. Supposing that this unhappy young man's story were
003632 absolutely true, then what hellish thing, what absolutely
003633 unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between
003634 the time when he parted from his father, and the moment when,
003635 drawn back by his screams, he rushed into the glade? It was
003636 something terrible and deadly. What could it be? Might not the
003637 nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts?
003638 I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper, which
003639 contained a verbatim account of the inquest. In the surgeon's
003640 deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left
003641 parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been
003642 shattered by a heavy blow from a blunt weapon. I marked the spot
003643 upon my own head. Clearly such a blow must have been struck from
003644 behind. That was to some extent in favour of the accused, as when
003645 seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father. Still, it
003646 did not go for very much, for the older man might have turned his
003647 back before the blow fell. Still, it might be worth while to call
003648 Holmes' attention to it. Then there was the peculiar dying
003649 reference to a rat. What could that mean? It could not be
003650 delirium. A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become
003651 delirious. No, it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how
003652 he met his fate. But what could it indicate? I cudgelled my
003653 brains to find some possible explanation. And then the incident
003654 of the grey cloth seen by young McCarthy. If that were true the
003655 murderer must have dropped some part of his dress, presumably his
003656 overcoat, in his flight, and must have had the hardihood to
003657 return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was
003658 kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off. What a
003659 tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole thing was! I
003660 did not wonder at Lestrade's opinion, and yet I had so much faith
003661 in Sherlock Holmes' insight that I could not lose hope as long
003662 as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young
003663 McCarthy's innocence.
003664 
003665 It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned. He came back alone,
003666 for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town.
003667 
003668 "The glass still keeps very high," he remarked as he sat down.
003669 "It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able
003670 to go over the ground. On the other hand, a man should be at his
003671 very best and keenest for such nice work as that, and I did not
003672 wish to do it when fagged by a long journey. I have seen young
003673 McCarthy."
003674 
003675 "And what did you learn from him?"
003676 
003677 "Nothing."
003678 
003679 "Could he throw no light?"
003680 
003681 "None at all. I was inclined to think at one time that he knew
003682 who had done it and was screening him or her, but I am convinced
003683 now that he is as puzzled as everyone else. He is not a very
003684 quick-witted youth, though comely to look at and, I should think,
003685 sound at heart."
003686 
003687 "I cannot admire his taste," I remarked, "if it is indeed a fact
003688 that he was averse to a marriage with so charming a young lady as
003689 this Miss Turner."
003690 
003691 "Ah, thereby hangs a rather painful tale. This fellow is madly,
003692 insanely, in love with her, but some two years ago, when he was
003693 only a lad, and before he really knew her, for she had been away
003694 five years at a boarding-school, what does the idiot do but get
003695 into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a
003696 registry office? No one knows a word of the matter, but you can
003697 imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not
003698 doing what he would give his very eyes to do, but what he knows
003699 to be absolutely impossible. It was sheer frenzy of this sort
003700 which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father,
003701 at their last interview, was goading him on to propose to Miss
003702 Turner. On the other hand, he had no means of supporting himself,
003703 and his father, who was by all accounts a very hard man, would
003704 have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth. It was with
003705 his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in
003706 Bristol, and his father did not know where he was. Mark that
003707 point. It is of importance. Good has come out of evil, however,
003708 for the barmaid, finding from the papers that he is in serious
003709 trouble and likely to be hanged, has thrown him over utterly and
003710 has written to him to say that she has a husband already in the
003711 Bermuda Dockyard, so that there is really no tie between them. I
003712 think that that bit of news has consoled young McCarthy for all
003713 that he has suffered."
003714 
003715 "But if he is innocent, who has done it?"
003716 
003717 "Ah! who? I would call your attention very particularly to two
003718 points. One is that the murdered man had an appointment with
003719 someone at the pool, and that the someone could not have been his
003720 son, for his son was away, and he did not know when he would
003721 return. The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry
003722 'Cooee!' before he knew that his son had returned. Those are the
003723 crucial points upon which the case depends. And now let us talk
003724 about George Meredith, if you please, and we shall leave all
003725 minor matters until to-morrow."
003726 
003727 There was no rain, as Holmes had foretold, and the morning broke
003728 bright and cloudless. At nine o'clock Lestrade called for us with
003729 the carriage, and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe
003730 Pool.
003731 
003732 "There is serious news this morning," Lestrade observed. "It is
003733 said that Mr. Turner, of the Hall, is so ill that his life is
003734 despaired of."
003735 
003736 "An elderly man, I presume?" said Holmes.
003737 
003738 "About sixty; but his constitution has been shattered by his life
003739 abroad, and he has been in failing health for some time. This
003740 business has had a very bad effect upon him. He was an old friend
003741 of McCarthy's, and, I may add, a great benefactor to him, for I
003742 have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free."
003743 
003744 "Indeed! That is interesting," said Holmes.
003745 
003746 "Oh, yes! In a hundred other ways he has helped him. Everybody
003747 about here speaks of his kindness to him."
003748 
003749 "Really! Does it not strike you as a little singular that this
003750 McCarthy, who appears to have had little of his own, and to have
003751 been under such obligations to Turner, should still talk of
003752 marrying his son to Turner's daughter, who is, presumably,
003753 heiress to the estate, and that in such a very cocksure manner,
003754 as if it were merely a case of a proposal and all else would
003755 follow? It is the more strange, since we know that Turner himself
003756 was averse to the idea. The daughter told us as much. Do you not
003757 deduce something from that?"
003758 
003759 "We have got to the deductions and the inferences," said
003760 Lestrade, winking at me. "I find it hard enough to tackle facts,
003761 Holmes, without flying away after theories and fancies."
003762 
003763 "You are right," said Holmes demurely; "you do find it very hard
003764 to tackle the facts."
003765 
003766 "Anyhow, I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it
003767 difficult to get hold of," replied Lestrade with some warmth.
003768 
003769 "And that is--"
003770 
003771 "That McCarthy senior met his death from McCarthy junior and that
003772 all theories to the contrary are the merest moonshine."
003773 
003774 "Well, moonshine is a brighter thing than fog," said Holmes,
003775 laughing. "But I am very much mistaken if this is not Hatherley
003776 Farm upon the left."
003777 
003778 "Yes, that is it." It was a widespread, comfortable-looking
003779 building, two-storied, slate-roofed, with great yellow blotches
003780 of lichen upon the grey walls. The drawn blinds and the smokeless
003781 chimneys, however, gave it a stricken look, as though the weight
003782 of this horror still lay heavy upon it. We called at the door,
003783 when the maid, at Holmes' request, showed us the boots which her
003784 master wore at the time of his death, and also a pair of the
003785 son's, though not the pair which he had then had. Having measured
003786 these very carefully from seven or eight different points, Holmes
003787 desired to be led to the court-yard, from which we all followed
003788 the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool.
003789 
003790 Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent
003791 as this. Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of
003792 Baker Street would have failed to recognise him. His face flushed
003793 and darkened. His brows were drawn into two hard black lines,
003794 while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter.
003795 His face was bent downward, his shoulders bowed, his lips
003796 compressed, and the veins stood out like whipcord in his long,
003797 sinewy neck. His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal
003798 lust for the chase, and his mind was so absolutely concentrated
003799 upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell
003800 unheeded upon his ears, or, at the most, only provoked a quick,
003801 impatient snarl in reply. Swiftly and silently he made his way
003802 along the track which ran through the meadows, and so by way of
003803 the woods to the Boscombe Pool. It was damp, marshy ground, as is
003804 all that district, and there were marks of many feet, both upon
003805 the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either
003806 side. Sometimes Holmes would hurry on, sometimes stop dead, and
003807 once he made quite a little detour into the meadow. Lestrade and
003808 I walked behind him, the detective indifferent and contemptuous,
003809 while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the
003810 conviction that every one of his actions was directed towards a
003811 definite end.
003812 
003813 The Boscombe Pool, which is a little reed-girt sheet of water
003814 some fifty yards across, is situated at the boundary between the
003815 Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr. Turner.
003816 Above the woods which lined it upon the farther side we could see
003817 the red, jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich
003818 landowner's dwelling. On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods
003819 grew very thick, and there was a narrow belt of sodden grass
003820 twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds
003821 which lined the lake. Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which
003822 the body had been found, and, indeed, so moist was the ground,
003823 that I could plainly see the traces which had been left by the
003824 fall of the stricken man. To Holmes, as I could see by his eager
003825 face and peering eyes, very many other things were to be read
003826 upon the trampled grass. He ran round, like a dog who is picking
003827 up a scent, and then turned upon my companion.
003828 
003829 "What did you go into the pool for?" he asked.
003830 
003831 "I fished about with a rake. I thought there might be some weapon
003832 or other trace. But how on earth--"
003833 
003834 "Oh, tut, tut! I have no time! That left foot of yours with its
003835 inward twist is all over the place. A mole could trace it, and
003836 there it vanishes among the reeds. Oh, how simple it would all
003837 have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo
003838 and wallowed all over it. Here is where the party with the
003839 lodge-keeper came, and they have covered all tracks for six or
003840 eight feet round the body. But here are three separate tracks of
003841 the same feet." He drew out a lens and lay down upon his
003842 waterproof to have a better view, talking all the time rather to
003843 himself than to us. "These are young McCarthy's feet. Twice he
003844 was walking, and once he ran swiftly, so that the soles are
003845 deeply marked and the heels hardly visible. That bears out his
003846 story. He ran when he saw his father on the ground. Then here are
003847 the father's feet as he paced up and down. What is this, then? It
003848 is the butt-end of the gun as the son stood listening. And this?
003849 Ha, ha! What have we here? Tiptoes! tiptoes! Square, too, quite
003850 unusual boots! They come, they go, they come again--of course
003851 that was for the cloak. Now where did they come from?" He ran up
003852 and down, sometimes losing, sometimes finding the track until we
003853 were well within the edge of the wood and under the shadow of a
003854 great beech, the largest tree in the neighbourhood. Holmes traced
003855 his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon
003856 his face with a little cry of satisfaction. For a long time he
003857 remained there, turning over the leaves and dried sticks,
003858 gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and
003859 examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of
003860 the tree as far as he could reach. A jagged stone was lying among
003861 the moss, and this also he carefully examined and retained. Then
003862 he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the
003863 highroad, where all traces were lost.
003864 
003865 "It has been a case of considerable interest," he remarked,
003866 returning to his natural manner. "I fancy that this grey house on
003867 the right must be the lodge. I think that I will go in and have a
003868 word with Moran, and perhaps write a little note. Having done
003869 that, we may drive back to our luncheon. You may walk to the cab,
003870 and I shall be with you presently."
003871 
003872 It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove
003873 back into Ross, Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he
003874 had picked up in the wood.
003875 
003876 "This may interest you, Lestrade," he remarked, holding it out.
003877 "The murder was done with it."
003878 
003879 "I see no marks."
003880 
003881 "There are none."
003882 
003883 "How do you know, then?"
003884 
003885 "The grass was growing under it. It had only lain there a few
003886 days. There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken. It
003887 corresponds with the injuries. There is no sign of any other
003888 weapon."
003889 
003890 "And the murderer?"
003891 
003892 "Is a tall man, left-handed, limps with the right leg, wears
003893 thick-soled shooting-boots and a grey cloak, smokes Indian
003894 cigars, uses a cigar-holder, and carries a blunt pen-knife in his
003895 pocket. There are several other indications, but these may be
003896 enough to aid us in our search."
003897 
003898 Lestrade laughed. "I am afraid that I am still a sceptic," he
003899 said. "Theories are all very well, but we have to deal with a
003900 hard-headed British jury."
003901 
003902 "Nous verrons," answered Holmes calmly. "You work your own
003903 method, and I shall work mine. I shall be busy this afternoon,
003904 and shall probably return to London by the evening train."
003905 
003906 "And leave your case unfinished?"
003907 
003908 "No, finished."
003909 
003910 "But the mystery?"
003911 
003912 "It is solved."
003913 
003914 "Who was the criminal, then?"
003915 
003916 "The gentleman I describe."
003917 
003918 "But who is he?"
003919 
003920 "Surely it would not be difficult to find out. This is not such a
003921 populous neighbourhood."
003922 
003923 Lestrade shrugged his shoulders. "I am a practical man," he said,
003924 "and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking
003925 for a left-handed gentleman with a game leg. I should become the
003926 laughing-stock of Scotland Yard."
003927 
003928 "All right," said Holmes quietly. "I have given you the chance.
003929 Here are your lodgings. Good-bye. I shall drop you a line before
003930 I leave."
003931 
003932 Having left Lestrade at his rooms, we drove to our hotel, where
003933 we found lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in
003934 thought with a pained expression upon his face, as one who finds
003935 himself in a perplexing position.
003936 
003937 "Look here, Watson," he said when the cloth was cleared "just sit
003938 down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little. I don't
003939 know quite what to do, and I should value your advice. Light a
003940 cigar and let me expound."
003941 
003942  "Pray do so."
003943 
003944 "Well, now, in considering this case there are two points about
003945 young McCarthy's narrative which struck us both instantly,
003946 although they impressed me in his favour and you against him. One
003947 was the fact that his father should, according to his account,
003948 cry 'Cooee!' before seeing him. The other was his singular dying
003949 reference to a rat. He mumbled several words, you understand, but
003950 that was all that caught the son's ear. Now from this double
003951 point our research must commence, and we will begin it by
003952 presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true."
003953 
003954 "What of this 'Cooee!' then?"
003955 
003956 "Well, obviously it could not have been meant for the son. The
003957 son, as far as he knew, was in Bristol. It was mere chance that
003958 he was within earshot. The 'Cooee!' was meant to attract the
003959 attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with. But
003960 'Cooee' is a distinctly Australian cry, and one which is used
003961 between Australians. There is a strong presumption that the
003962 person whom McCarthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was
003963 someone who had been in Australia."
003964 
003965 "What of the rat, then?"
003966 
003967 Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened
003968 it out on the table. "This is a map of the Colony of Victoria,"
003969 he said. "I wired to Bristol for it last night." He put his hand
003970 over part of the map. "What do you read?"
003971 
003972 "ARAT," I read.
003973 
003974 "And now?" He raised his hand.
003975 
003976 "BALLARAT."
003977 
003978 "Quite so. That was the word the man uttered, and of which his
003979 son only caught the last two syllables. He was trying to utter
003980 the name of his murderer. So and so, of Ballarat."
003981 
003982 "It is wonderful!" I exclaimed.
003983 
003984 "It is obvious. And now, you see, I had narrowed the field down
003985 considerably. The possession of a grey garment was a third point
003986 which, granting the son's statement to be correct, was a
003987 certainty. We have come now out of mere vagueness to the definite
003988 conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak."
003989 
003990 "Certainly."
003991 
003992 "And one who was at home in the district, for the pool can only
003993 be approached by the farm or by the estate, where strangers could
003994 hardly wander."
003995 
003996 "Quite so."
003997 
003998 "Then comes our expedition of to-day. By an examination of the
003999 ground I gained the trifling details which I gave to that
004000 imbecile Lestrade, as to the personality of the criminal."
004001 
004002 "But how did you gain them?"
004003 
004004 "You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of
004005 trifles."
004006 
004007 "His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length
004008 of his stride. His boots, too, might be told from their traces."
004009 
004010 "Yes, they were peculiar boots."
004011 
004012 "But his lameness?"
004013 
004014 "The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than
004015 his left. He put less weight upon it. Why? Because he limped--he
004016 was lame."
004017 
004018 "But his left-handedness."
004019 
004020 "You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded
004021 by the surgeon at the inquest. The blow was struck from
004022 immediately behind, and yet was upon the left side. Now, how can
004023 that be unless it were by a left-handed man? He had stood behind
004024 that tree during the interview between the father and son. He had
004025 even smoked there. I found the ash of a cigar, which my special
004026 knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian
004027 cigar. I have, as you know, devoted some attention to this, and
004028 written a little monograph on the ashes of 140 different
004029 varieties of pipe, cigar, and cigarette tobacco. Having found the
004030 ash, I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss
004031 where he had tossed it. It was an Indian cigar, of the variety
004032 which are rolled in Rotterdam."
004033 
004034 "And the cigar-holder?"
004035 
004036 "I could see that the end had not been in his mouth. Therefore he
004037 used a holder. The tip had been cut off, not bitten off, but the
004038 cut was not a clean one, so I deduced a blunt pen-knife."
004039 
004040 "Holmes," I said, "you have drawn a net round this man from which
004041 he cannot escape, and you have saved an innocent human life as
004042 truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him. I see the
004043 direction in which all this points. The culprit is--"
004044 
004045 "Mr. John Turner," cried the hotel waiter, opening the door of
004046 our sitting-room, and ushering in a visitor.
004047 
004048 The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure. His
004049 slow, limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of
004050 decrepitude, and yet his hard, deep-lined, craggy features, and
004051 his enormous limbs showed that he was possessed of unusual
004052 strength of body and of character. His tangled beard, grizzled
004053 hair, and outstanding, drooping eyebrows combined to give an air
004054 of dignity and power to his appearance, but his face was of an
004055 ashen white, while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were
004056 tinged with a shade of blue. It was clear to me at a glance that
004057 he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease.
004058 
004059 "Pray sit down on the sofa," said Holmes gently. "You had my
004060 note?"
004061 
004062 "Yes, the lodge-keeper brought it up. You said that you wished to
004063 see me here to avoid scandal."
004064 
004065 "I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall."
004066 
004067 "And why did you wish to see me?" He looked across at my
004068 companion with despair in his weary eyes, as though his question
004069 was already answered.
004070 
004071 "Yes," said Holmes, answering the look rather than the words. "It
004072 is so. I know all about McCarthy."
004073 
004074 The old man sank his face in his hands. "God help me!" he cried.
004075 "But I would not have let the young man come to harm. I give you
004076 my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at
004077 the Assizes."
004078 
004079 "I am glad to hear you say so," said Holmes gravely.
004080 
004081 "I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl. It
004082 would break her heart--it will break her heart when she hears
004083 that I am arrested."
004084 
004085 "It may not come to that," said Holmes.
004086 
004087 "What?"
004088 
004089 "I am no official agent. I understand that it was your daughter
004090 who required my presence here, and I am acting in her interests.
004091 Young McCarthy must be got off, however."
004092 
004093 "I am a dying man," said old Turner. "I have had diabetes for
004094 years. My doctor says it is a question whether I shall live a
004095 month. Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol."
004096 
004097 Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand
004098 and a bundle of paper before him. "Just tell us the truth," he
004099 said. "I shall jot down the facts. You will sign it, and Watson
004100 here can witness it. Then I could produce your confession at the
004101 last extremity to save young McCarthy. I promise you that I shall
004102 not use it unless it is absolutely needed."
004103 
004104 "It's as well," said the old man; "it's a question whether I
004105 shall live to the Assizes, so it matters little to me, but I
004106 should wish to spare Alice the shock. And now I will make the
004107 thing clear to you; it has been a long time in the acting, but
004108 will not take me long to tell.
004109 
004110 "You didn't know this dead man, McCarthy. He was a devil
004111 incarnate. I tell you that. God keep you out of the clutches of
004112 such a man as he. His grip has been upon me these twenty years,
004113 and he has blasted my life. I'll tell you first how I came to be
004114 in his power.
004115 
004116 "It was in the early '60's at the diggings. I was a young chap
004117 then, hot-blooded and reckless, ready to turn my hand at
004118 anything; I got among bad companions, took to drink, had no luck
004119 with my claim, took to the bush, and in a word became what you
004120 would call over here a highway robber. There were six of us, and
004121 we had a wild, free life of it, sticking up a station from time
004122 to time, or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings.
004123 Black Jack of Ballarat was the name I went under, and our party
004124 is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang.
004125 
004126 "One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne, and
004127 we lay in wait for it and attacked it. There were six troopers
004128 and six of us, so it was a close thing, but we emptied four of
004129 their saddles at the first volley. Three of our boys were killed,
004130 however, before we got the swag. I put my pistol to the head of
004131 the wagon-driver, who was this very man McCarthy. I wish to the
004132 Lord that I had shot him then, but I spared him, though I saw his
004133 wicked little eyes fixed on my face, as though to remember every
004134 feature. We got away with the gold, became wealthy men, and made
004135 our way over to England without being suspected. There I parted
004136 from my old pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and
004137 respectable life. I bought this estate, which chanced to be in
004138 the market, and I set myself to do a little good with my money,
004139 to make up for the way in which I had earned it. I married, too,
004140 and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice.
004141 Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down
004142 the right path as nothing else had ever done. In a word, I turned
004143 over a new leaf and did my best to make up for the past. All was
004144 going well when McCarthy laid his grip upon me.
004145 
004146 "I had gone up to town about an investment, and I met him in
004147 Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his
004148 foot.
004149 
004150 "'Here we are, Jack,' says he, touching me on the arm; 'we'll be
004151 as good as a family to you. There's two of us, me and my son, and
004152 you can have the keeping of us. If you don't--it's a fine,
004153 law-abiding country is England, and there's always a policeman
004154 within hail.'
004155 
004156 "Well, down they came to the west country, there was no shaking
004157 them off, and there they have lived rent free on my best land
004158 ever since. There was no rest for me, no peace, no forgetfulness;
004159 turn where I would, there was his cunning, grinning face at my
004160 elbow. It grew worse as Alice grew up, for he soon saw I was more
004161 afraid of her knowing my past than of the police. Whatever he
004162 wanted he must have, and whatever it was I gave him without
004163 question, land, money, houses, until at last he asked a thing
004164 which I could not give. He asked for Alice.
004165 
004166 "His son, you see, had grown up, and so had my girl, and as I was
004167 known to be in weak health, it seemed a fine stroke to him that
004168 his lad should step into the whole property. But there I was
004169 firm. I would not have his cursed stock mixed with mine; not that
004170 I had any dislike to the lad, but his blood was in him, and that
004171 was enough. I stood firm. McCarthy threatened. I braved him to do
004172 his worst. We were to meet at the pool midway between our houses
004173 to talk it over.
004174 
004175 "When I went down there I found him talking with his son, so I
004176 smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone.
004177 But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in
004178 me seemed to come uppermost. He was urging his son to marry my
004179 daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she
004180 were a slut from off the streets. It drove me mad to think that I
004181 and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a
004182 man as this. Could I not snap the bond? I was already a dying and
004183 a desperate man. Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb,
004184 I knew that my own fate was sealed. But my memory and my girl!
004185 Both could be saved if I could but silence that foul tongue. I
004186 did it, Mr. Holmes. I would do it again. Deeply as I have sinned,
004187 I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it. But that my girl
004188 should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more
004189 than I could suffer. I struck him down with no more compunction
004190 than if he had been some foul and venomous beast. His cry brought
004191 back his son; but I had gained the cover of the wood, though I
004192 was forced to go back to fetch the cloak which I had dropped in
004193 my flight. That is the true story, gentlemen, of all that
004194 occurred."
004195 
004196 "Well, it is not for me to judge you," said Holmes as the old man
004197 signed the statement which had been drawn out. "I pray that we
004198 may never be exposed to such a temptation."
004199 
004200 "I pray not, sir. And what do you intend to do?"
004201 
004202 "In view of your health, nothing. You are yourself aware that you
004203 will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the
004204 Assizes. I will keep your confession, and if McCarthy is
004205 condemned I shall be forced to use it. If not, it shall never be
004206 seen by mortal eye; and your secret, whether you be alive or
004207 dead, shall be safe with us."
004208 
004209 "Farewell, then," said the old man solemnly. "Your own deathbeds,
004210 when they come, will be the easier for the thought of the peace
004211 which you have given to mine." Tottering and shaking in all his
004212 giant frame, he stumbled slowly from the room.
004213 
004214 "God help us!" said Holmes after a long silence. "Why does fate
004215 play such tricks with poor, helpless worms? I never hear of such
004216 a case as this that I do not think of Baxter's words, and say,
004217 'There, but for the grace of God, goes Sherlock Holmes.'"
004218 
004219 James McCarthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a
004220 number of objections which had been drawn out by Holmes and
004221 submitted to the defending counsel. Old Turner lived for seven
004222 months after our interview, but he is now dead; and there is
004223 every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily
004224 together in ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their
004225 past.

004228 
004229 ADVENTURE V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
004230 
004231 When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes
004232 cases between the years '82 and '90, I am faced by so many which
004233 present strange and interesting features that it is no easy
004234 matter to know which to choose and which to leave. Some, however,
004235 have already gained publicity through the papers, and others have
004236 not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend
004237 possessed in so high a degree, and which it is the object of
004238 these papers to illustrate. Some, too, have baffled his
004239 analytical skill, and would be, as narratives, beginnings without
004240 an ending, while others have been but partially cleared up, and
004241 have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and
004242 surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to
004243 him. There is, however, one of these last which was so remarkable
004244 in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted
004245 to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are
004246 points in connection with it which never have been, and probably
004247 never will be, entirely cleared up.
004248 
004249 The year '87 furnished us with a long series of cases of greater
004250 or less interest, of which I retain the records. Among my
004251 headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the
004252 adventure of the Paradol Chamber, of the Amateur Mendicant
004253 Society, who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a
004254 furniture warehouse, of the facts connected with the loss of the
004255 British barque "Sophy Anderson", of the singular adventures of the
004256 Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa, and finally of the
004257 Camberwell poisoning case. In the latter, as may be remembered,
004258 Sherlock Holmes was able, by winding up the dead man's watch, to
004259 prove that it had been wound up two hours before, and that
004260 therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time--a
004261 deduction which was of the greatest importance in clearing up the
004262 case. All these I may sketch out at some future date, but none of
004263 them present such singular features as the strange train of
004264 circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to describe.
004265 
004266 It was in the latter days of September, and the equinoctial gales
004267 had set in with exceptional violence. All day the wind had
004268 screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows, so that
004269 even here in the heart of great, hand-made London we were forced
004270 to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and
004271 to recognise the presence of those great elemental forces which
004272 shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation, like
004273 untamed beasts in a cage. As evening drew in, the storm grew
004274 higher and louder, and the wind cried and sobbed like a child in
004275 the chimney. Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the
004276 fireplace cross-indexing his records of crime, while I at the
004277 other was deep in one of Clark Russell's fine sea-stories until
004278 the howl of the gale from without seemed to blend with the text,
004279 and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of
004280 the sea waves. My wife was on a visit to her mother's, and for a
004281 few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters at Baker
004282 Street.
004283 
004284 "Why," said I, glancing up at my companion, "that was surely the
004285 bell. Who could come to-night? Some friend of yours, perhaps?"
004286 
004287 "Except yourself I have none," he answered. "I do not encourage
004288 visitors."
004289 
004290 "A client, then?"
004291 
004292 "If so, it is a serious case. Nothing less would bring a man out
004293 on such a day and at such an hour. But I take it that it is more
004294 likely to be some crony of the landlady's."
004295 
004296 Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture, however, for there
004297 came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door. He
004298 stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and
004299 towards the vacant chair upon which a newcomer must sit.
004300 
004301 "Come in!" said he.
004302 
004303 The man who entered was young, some two-and-twenty at the
004304 outside, well-groomed and trimly clad, with something of
004305 refinement and delicacy in his bearing. The streaming umbrella
004306 which he held in his hand, and his long shining waterproof told
004307 of the fierce weather through which he had come. He looked about
004308 him anxiously in the glare of the lamp, and I could see that his
004309 face was pale and his eyes heavy, like those of a man who is
004310 weighed down with some great anxiety.
004311 
004312 "I owe you an apology," he said, raising his golden pince-nez to
004313 his eyes. "I trust that I am not intruding. I fear that I have
004314 brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug
004315 chamber."
004316 
004317 "Give me your coat and umbrella," said Holmes. "They may rest
004318 here on the hook and will be dry presently. You have come up from
004319 the south-west, I see."
004320 
004321 "Yes, from Horsham."
004322 
004323 "That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is
004324 quite distinctive."
004325 
004326 "I have come for advice."
004327 
004328 "That is easily got."
004329 
004330 "And help."
004331 
004332 "That is not always so easy."
004333 
004334 "I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes. I heard from Major Prendergast
004335 how you saved him in the Tankerville Club scandal."
004336 
004337 "Ah, of course. He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards."
004338 
004339 "He said that you could solve anything."
004340 
004341 "He said too much."
004342 
004343 "That you are never beaten."
004344 
004345 "I have been beaten four times--three times by men, and once by a
004346 woman."
004347 
004348 "But what is that compared with the number of your successes?"
004349 
004350 "It is true that I have been generally successful."
004351 
004352 "Then you may be so with me."
004353 
004354 "I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me
004355 with some details as to your case."
004356 
004357 "It is no ordinary one."
004358 
004359 "None of those which come to me are. I am the last court of
004360 appeal."
004361 
004362 "And yet I question, sir, whether, in all your experience, you
004363 have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of
004364 events than those which have happened in my own family."
004365 
004366 "You fill me with interest," said Holmes. "Pray give us the
004367 essential facts from the commencement, and I can afterwards
004368 question you as to those details which seem to me to be most
004369 important."
004370 
004371 The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out
004372 towards the blaze.
004373 
004374 "My name," said he, "is John Openshaw, but my own affairs have,
004375 as far as I can understand, little to do with this awful
004376 business. It is a hereditary matter; so in order to give you an
004377 idea of the facts, I must go back to the commencement of the
004378 affair.
004379 
004380 "You must know that my grandfather had two sons--my uncle Elias
004381 and my father Joseph. My father had a small factory at Coventry,
004382 which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling. He
004383 was a patentee of the Openshaw unbreakable tire, and his business
004384 met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire
004385 upon a handsome competence.
004386 
004387 "My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and
004388 became a planter in Florida, where he was reported to have done
004389 very well. At the time of the war he fought in Jackson's army,
004390 and afterwards under Hood, where he rose to be a colonel. When
004391 Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation, where
004392 he remained for three or four years. About 1869 or 1870 he came
004393 back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex, near Horsham.
004394 He had made a very considerable fortune in the States, and his
004395 reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes, and his
004396 dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to
004397 them. He was a singular man, fierce and quick-tempered, very
004398 foul-mouthed when he was angry, and of a most retiring
004399 disposition. During all the years that he lived at Horsham, I
004400 doubt if ever he set foot in the town. He had a garden and two or
004401 three fields round his house, and there he would take his
004402 exercise, though very often for weeks on end he would never leave
004403 his room. He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very
004404 heavily, but he would see no society and did not want any
004405 friends, not even his own brother.
004406 
004407 "He didn't mind me; in fact, he took a fancy to me, for at the
004408 time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so. This
004409 would be in the year 1878, after he had been eight or nine years
004410 in England. He begged my father to let me live with him and he
004411 was very kind to me in his way. When he was sober he used to be
004412 fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me, and he would
004413 make me his representative both with the servants and with the
004414 tradespeople, so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite
004415 master of the house. I kept all the keys and could go where I
004416 liked and do what I liked, so long as I did not disturb him in
004417 his privacy. There was one singular exception, however, for he
004418 had a single room, a lumber-room up among the attics, which was
004419 invariably locked, and which he would never permit either me or
004420 anyone else to enter. With a boy's curiosity I have peeped
004421 through the keyhole, but I was never able to see more than such a
004422 collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such
004423 a room.
004424 
004425 "One day--it was in March, 1883--a letter with a foreign stamp
004426 lay upon the table in front of the colonel's plate. It was not a
004427 common thing for him to receive letters, for his bills were all
004428 paid in ready money, and he had no friends of any sort. 'From
004429 India!' said he as he took it up, 'Pondicherry postmark! What can
004430 this be?' Opening it hurriedly, out there jumped five little
004431 dried orange pips, which pattered down upon his plate. I began to
004432 laugh at this, but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight
004433 of his face. His lip had fallen, his eyes were protruding, his
004434 skin the colour of putty, and he glared at the envelope which he
004435 still held in his trembling hand, 'K. K. K.!' he shrieked, and
004436 then, 'My God, my God, my sins have overtaken me!'
004437 
004438 "'What is it, uncle?' I cried.
004439 
004440 "'Death,' said he, and rising from the table he retired to his
004441 room, leaving me palpitating with horror. I took up the envelope
004442 and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap, just above the
004443 gum, the letter K three times repeated. There was nothing else
004444 save the five dried pips. What could be the reason of his
004445 overpowering terror? I left the breakfast-table, and as I
004446 ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key,
004447 which must have belonged to the attic, in one hand, and a small
004448 brass box, like a cashbox, in the other.
004449 
004450 "'They may do what they like, but I'll checkmate them still,'
004451 said he with an oath. 'Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my
004452 room to-day, and send down to Fordham, the Horsham lawyer.'
004453 
004454 "I did as he ordered, and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to
004455 step up to the room. The fire was burning brightly, and in the
004456 grate there was a mass of black, fluffy ashes, as of burned
004457 paper, while the brass box stood open and empty beside it. As I
004458 glanced at the box I noticed, with a start, that upon the lid was
004459 printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the
004460 envelope.
004461 
004462 "'I wish you, John,' said my uncle, 'to witness my will. I leave
004463 my estate, with all its advantages and all its disadvantages, to
004464 my brother, your father, whence it will, no doubt, descend to
004465 you. If you can enjoy it in peace, well and good! If you find you
004466 cannot, take my advice, my boy, and leave it to your deadliest
004467 enemy. I am sorry to give you such a two-edged thing, but I can't
004468 say what turn things are going to take. Kindly sign the paper
004469 where Mr. Fordham shows you.'
004470 
004471 "I signed the paper as directed, and the lawyer took it away with
004472 him. The singular incident made, as you may think, the deepest
004473 impression upon me, and I pondered over it and turned it every
004474 way in my mind without being able to make anything of it. Yet I
004475 could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left
004476 behind, though the sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed
004477 and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives. I
004478 could see a change in my uncle, however. He drank more than ever,
004479 and he was less inclined for any sort of society. Most of his
004480 time he would spend in his room, with the door locked upon the
004481 inside, but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy
004482 and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a
004483 revolver in his hand, screaming out that he was afraid of no man,
004484 and that he was not to be cooped up, like a sheep in a pen, by
004485 man or devil. When these hot fits were over, however, he would
004486 rush tumultuously in at the door and lock and bar it behind him,
004487 like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror
004488 which lies at the roots of his soul. At such times I have seen
004489 his face, even on a cold day, glisten with moisture, as though it
004490 were new raised from a basin.
004491 
004492 "Well, to come to an end of the matter, Mr. Holmes, and not to
004493 abuse your patience, there came a night when he made one of those
004494 drunken sallies from which he never came back. We found him, when
004495 we went to search for him, face downward in a little
004496 green-scummed pool, which lay at the foot of the garden. There
004497 was no sign of any violence, and the water was but two feet deep,
004498 so that the jury, having regard to his known eccentricity,
004499 brought in a verdict of 'suicide.' But I, who knew how he winced
004500 from the very thought of death, had much ado to persuade myself
004501 that he had gone out of his way to meet it. The matter passed,
004502 however, and my father entered into possession of the estate, and
004503 of some 14,000 pounds, which lay to his credit at the bank."
004504 
004505 "One moment," Holmes interposed, "your statement is, I foresee,
004506 one of the most remarkable to which I have ever listened. Let me
004507 have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter, and
004508 the date of his supposed suicide."
004509 
004510 "The letter arrived on March 10, 1883. His death was seven weeks
004511 later, upon the night of May 2nd."
004512 
004513 "Thank you. Pray proceed."
004514 
004515 "When my father took over the Horsham property, he, at my
004516 request, made a careful examination of the attic, which had been
004517 always locked up. We found the brass box there, although its
004518 contents had been destroyed. On the inside of the cover was a
004519 paper label, with the initials of K. K. K. repeated upon it, and
004520 'Letters, memoranda, receipts, and a register' written beneath.
004521 These, we presume, indicated the nature of the papers which had
004522 been destroyed by Colonel Openshaw. For the rest, there was
004523 nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many
004524 scattered papers and note-books bearing upon my uncle's life in
004525 America. Some of them were of the war time and showed that he had
004526 done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier.
004527 Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern
004528 states, and were mostly concerned with politics, for he had
004529 evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet-bag
004530 politicians who had been sent down from the North.
004531 
004532 "Well, it was the beginning of '84 when my father came to live at
004533 Horsham, and all went as well as possible with us until the
004534 January of '85. On the fourth day after the new year I heard my
004535 father give a sharp cry of surprise as we sat together at the
004536 breakfast-table. There he was, sitting with a newly opened
004537 envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the
004538 outstretched palm of the other one. He had always laughed at what
004539 he called my cock-and-bull story about the colonel, but he looked
004540 very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon
004541 himself.
004542 
004543 "'Why, what on earth does this mean, John?' he stammered.
004544 
004545 "My heart had turned to lead. 'It is K. K. K.,' said I.
004546 
004547 "He looked inside the envelope. 'So it is,' he cried. 'Here are
004548 the very letters. But what is this written above them?'
004549 
004550 "'Put the papers on the sundial,' I read, peeping over his
004551 shoulder.
004552 
004553 "'What papers? What sundial?' he asked.
004554 
004555 "'The sundial in the garden. There is no other,' said I; 'but the
004556 papers must be those that are destroyed.'
004557 
004558 "'Pooh!' said he, gripping hard at his courage. 'We are in a
004559 civilised land here, and we can't have tomfoolery of this kind.
004560 Where does the thing come from?'
004561 
004562 "'From Dundee,' I answered, glancing at the postmark.
004563 
004564 "'Some preposterous practical joke,' said he. 'What have I to do
004565 with sundials and papers? I shall take no notice of such
004566 nonsense.'
004567 
004568 "'I should certainly speak to the police,' I said.
004569 
004570 "'And be laughed at for my pains. Nothing of the sort.'
004571 
004572 "'Then let me do so?'
004573 
004574 "'No, I forbid you. I won't have a fuss made about such
004575 nonsense.'
004576 
004577 "It was in vain to argue with him, for he was a very obstinate
004578 man. I went about, however, with a heart which was full of
004579 forebodings.
004580 
004581 "On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went
004582 from home to visit an old friend of his, Major Freebody, who is
004583 in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill. I was glad
004584 that he should go, for it seemed to me that he was farther from
004585 danger when he was away from home. In that, however, I was in
004586 error. Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram
004587 from the major, imploring me to come at once. My father had
004588 fallen over one of the deep chalk-pits which abound in the
004589 neighbourhood, and was lying senseless, with a shattered skull. I
004590 hurried to him, but he passed away without having ever recovered
004591 his consciousness. He had, as it appears, been returning from
004592 Fareham in the twilight, and as the country was unknown to him,
004593 and the chalk-pit unfenced, the jury had no hesitation in
004594 bringing in a verdict of 'death from accidental causes.'
004595 Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death, I
004596 was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of
004597 murder. There were no signs of violence, no footmarks, no
004598 robbery, no record of strangers having been seen upon the roads.
004599 And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease,
004600 and that I was well-nigh certain that some foul plot had been
004601 woven round him.
004602 
004603 "In this sinister way I came into my inheritance. You will ask me
004604 why I did not dispose of it? I answer, because I was well
004605 convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an
004606 incident in my uncle's life, and that the danger would be as
004607 pressing in one house as in another.
004608 
004609 "It was in January, '85, that my poor father met his end, and two
004610 years and eight months have elapsed since then. During that time
004611 I have lived happily at Horsham, and I had begun to hope that
004612 this curse had passed away from the family, and that it had ended
004613 with the last generation. I had begun to take comfort too soon,
004614 however; yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in
004615 which it had come upon my father."
004616 
004617 The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope, and
004618 turning to the table he shook out upon it five little dried
004619 orange pips.
004620 
004621 "This is the envelope," he continued. "The postmark is
004622 London--eastern division. Within are the very words which were
004623 upon my father's last message: 'K. K. K.'; and then 'Put the
004624 papers on the sundial.'"
004625 
004626 "What have you done?" asked Holmes.
004627 
004628 "Nothing."
004629 
004630 "Nothing?"
004631 
004632 "To tell the truth"--he sank his face into his thin, white
004633 hands--"I have felt helpless. I have felt like one of those poor
004634 rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it. I seem to be in
004635 the grasp of some resistless, inexorable evil, which no foresight
004636 and no precautions can guard against."
004637 
004638 "Tut! tut!" cried Sherlock Holmes. "You must act, man, or you are
004639 lost. Nothing but energy can save you. This is no time for
004640 despair."
004641 
004642 "I have seen the police."
004643 
004644 "Ah!"
004645 
004646 "But they listened to my story with a smile. I am convinced that
004647 the inspector has formed the opinion that the letters are all
004648 practical jokes, and that the deaths of my relations were really
004649 accidents, as the jury stated, and were not to be connected with
004650 the warnings."
004651 
004652 Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air. "Incredible
004653 imbecility!" he cried.
004654 
004655 "They have, however, allowed me a policeman, who may remain in
004656 the house with me."
004657 
004658 "Has he come with you to-night?"
004659 
004660 "No. His orders were to stay in the house."
004661 
004662 Again Holmes raved in the air.
004663 
004664 "Why did you come to me," he cried, "and, above all, why did you
004665 not come at once?"
004666 
004667 "I did not know. It was only to-day that I spoke to Major
004668 Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by him to come to
004669 you."
004670 
004671 "It is really two days since you had the letter. We should have
004672 acted before this. You have no further evidence, I suppose, than
004673 that which you have placed before us--no suggestive detail which
004674 might help us?"
004675 
004676 "There is one thing," said John Openshaw. He rummaged in his coat
004677 pocket, and, drawing out a piece of discoloured, blue-tinted
004678 paper, he laid it out upon the table. "I have some remembrance,"
004679 said he, "that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I
004680 observed that the small, unburned margins which lay amid the
004681 ashes were of this particular colour. I found this single sheet
004682 upon the floor of his room, and I am inclined to think that it
004683 may be one of the papers which has, perhaps, fluttered out from
004684 among the others, and in that way has escaped destruction. Beyond
004685 the mention of pips, I do not see that it helps us much. I think
004686 myself that it is a page from some private diary. The writing is
004687 undoubtedly my uncle's."
004688 
004689 Holmes moved the lamp, and we both bent over the sheet of paper,
004690 which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from
004691 a book. It was headed, "March, 1869," and beneath were the
004692 following enigmatical notices:
004693 
004694 "4th. Hudson came. Same old platform.
004695 
004696 "7th. Set the pips on McCauley, Paramore, and
004697       John Swain, of St. Augustine.
004698 
004699 "9th. McCauley cleared.
004700 
004701 "10th. John Swain cleared.
004702 
004703 "12th. Visited Paramore. All well."
004704 
004705 "Thank you!" said Holmes, folding up the paper and returning it
004706 to our visitor. "And now you must on no account lose another
004707 instant. We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told
004708 me. You must get home instantly and act."
004709 
004710 "What shall I do?"
004711 
004712 "There is but one thing to do. It must be done at once. You must
004713 put this piece of paper which you have shown us into the brass
004714 box which you have described. You must also put in a note to say
004715 that all the other papers were burned by your uncle, and that
004716 this is the only one which remains. You must assert that in such
004717 words as will carry conviction with them. Having done this, you
004718 must at once put the box out upon the sundial, as directed. Do
004719 you understand?"
004720 
004721 "Entirely."
004722 
004723 "Do not think of revenge, or anything of the sort, at present. I
004724 think that we may gain that by means of the law; but we have our
004725 web to weave, while theirs is already woven. The first
004726 consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens
004727 you. The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the
004728 guilty parties."
004729 
004730 "I thank you," said the young man, rising and pulling on his
004731 overcoat. "You have given me fresh life and hope. I shall
004732 certainly do as you advise."
004733 
004734 "Do not lose an instant. And, above all, take care of yourself in
004735 the meanwhile, for I do not think that there can be a doubt that
004736 you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger. How do you
004737 go back?"
004738 
004739 "By train from Waterloo."
004740 
004741 "It is not yet nine. The streets will be crowded, so I trust that
004742 you may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too
004743 closely."
004744 
004745 "I am armed."
004746 
004747 "That is well. To-morrow I shall set to work upon your case."
004748 
004749 "I shall see you at Horsham, then?"
004750 
004751 "No, your secret lies in London. It is there that I shall seek
004752 it."
004753 
004754 "Then I shall call upon you in a day, or in two days, with news
004755 as to the box and the papers. I shall take your advice in every
004756 particular." He shook hands with us and took his leave. Outside
004757 the wind still screamed and the rain splashed and pattered
004758 against the windows. This strange, wild story seemed to have come
004759 to us from amid the mad elements--blown in upon us like a sheet
004760 of sea-weed in a gale--and now to have been reabsorbed by them
004761 once more.
004762 
004763 Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence, with his head sunk
004764 forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire. Then he
004765 lit his pipe, and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue
004766 smoke-rings as they chased each other up to the ceiling.
004767 
004768 "I think, Watson," he remarked at last, "that of all our cases we
004769 have had none more fantastic than this."
004770 
004771 "Save, perhaps, the Sign of Four."
004772 
004773 "Well, yes. Save, perhaps, that. And yet this John Openshaw seems
004774 to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the
004775 Sholtos."
004776 
004777 "But have you," I asked, "formed any definite conception as to
004778 what these perils are?"
004779 
004780 "There can be no question as to their nature," he answered.
004781 
004782 "Then what are they? Who is this K. K. K., and why does he pursue
004783 this unhappy family?"
004784 
004785 Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the
004786 arms of his chair, with his finger-tips together. "The ideal
004787 reasoner," he remarked, "would, when he had once been shown a
004788 single fact in all its bearings, deduce from it not only all the
004789 chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which
004790 would follow from it. As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole
004791 animal by the contemplation of a single bone, so the observer who
004792 has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents
004793 should be able to accurately state all the other ones, both
004794 before and after. We have not yet grasped the results which the
004795 reason alone can attain to. Problems may be solved in the study
004796 which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the
004797 aid of their senses. To carry the art, however, to its highest
004798 pitch, it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to
004799 utilise all the facts which have come to his knowledge; and this
004800 in itself implies, as you will readily see, a possession of all
004801 knowledge, which, even in these days of free education and
004802 encyclopaedias, is a somewhat rare accomplishment. It is not so
004803 impossible, however, that a man should possess all knowledge
004804 which is likely to be useful to him in his work, and this I have
004805 endeavoured in my case to do. If I remember rightly, you on one
004806 occasion, in the early days of our friendship, defined my limits
004807 in a very precise fashion."
004808 
004809 "Yes," I answered, laughing. "It was a singular document.
004810 Philosophy, astronomy, and politics were marked at zero, I
004811 remember. Botany variable, geology profound as regards the
004812 mud-stains from any region within fifty miles of town, chemistry
004813 eccentric, anatomy unsystematic, sensational literature and crime
004814 records unique, violin-player, boxer, swordsman, lawyer, and
004815 self-poisoner by cocaine and tobacco. Those, I think, were the
004816 main points of my analysis."
004817 
004818 Holmes grinned at the last item. "Well," he said, "I say now, as
004819 I said then, that a man should keep his little brain-attic
004820 stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use, and the
004821 rest he can put away in the lumber-room of his library, where he
004822 can get it if he wants it. Now, for such a case as the one which
004823 has been submitted to us to-night, we need certainly to muster
004824 all our resources. Kindly hand me down the letter K of the
004825 'American Encyclopaedia' which stands upon the shelf beside you.
004826 Thank you. Now let us consider the situation and see what may be
004827 deduced from it. In the first place, we may start with a strong
004828 presumption that Colonel Openshaw had some very strong reason for
004829 leaving America. Men at his time of life do not change all their
004830 habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for
004831 the lonely life of an English provincial town. His extreme love
004832 of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of
004833 someone or something, so we may assume as a working hypothesis
004834 that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from
004835 America. As to what it was he feared, we can only deduce that by
004836 considering the formidable letters which were received by himself
004837 and his successors. Did you remark the postmarks of those
004838 letters?"
004839 
004840 "The first was from Pondicherry, the second from Dundee, and the
004841 third from London."
004842 
004843 "From East London. What do you deduce from that?"
004844 
004845 "They are all seaports. That the writer was on board of a ship."
004846 
004847 "Excellent. We have already a clue. There can be no doubt that
004848 the probability--the strong probability--is that the writer was
004849 on board of a ship. And now let us consider another point. In the
004850 case of Pondicherry, seven weeks elapsed between the threat and
004851 its fulfilment, in Dundee it was only some three or four days.
004852 Does that suggest anything?"
004853 
004854 "A greater distance to travel."
004855 
004856 "But the letter had also a greater distance to come."
004857 
004858 "Then I do not see the point."
004859 
004860 "There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man
004861 or men are is a sailing-ship. It looks as if they always send
004862 their singular warning or token before them when starting upon
004863 their mission. You see how quickly the deed followed the sign
004864 when it came from Dundee. If they had come from Pondicherry in a
004865 steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter.
004866 But, as a matter of fact, seven weeks elapsed. I think that those
004867 seven weeks represented the difference between the mail-boat which
004868 brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the
004869 writer."
004870 
004871 "It is possible."
004872 
004873 "More than that. It is probable. And now you see the deadly
004874 urgency of this new case, and why I urged young Openshaw to
004875 caution. The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which
004876 it would take the senders to travel the distance. But this one
004877 comes from London, and therefore we cannot count upon delay."
004878 
004879 "Good God!" I cried. "What can it mean, this relentless
004880 persecution?"
004881 
004882 "The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital
004883 importance to the person or persons in the sailing-ship. I think
004884 that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them.
004885 A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way
004886 as to deceive a coroner's jury. There must have been several in
004887 it, and they must have been men of resource and determination.
004888 Their papers they mean to have, be the holder of them who it may.
004889 In this way you see K. K. K. ceases to be the initials of an
004890 individual and becomes the badge of a society."
004891 
004892 "But of what society?"
004893 
004894 "Have you never--" said Sherlock Holmes, bending forward and
004895 sinking his voice--"have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan?"
004896 
004897 "I never have."
004898 
004899 Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee. "Here it
004900 is," said he presently:
004901 
004902 "'Ku Klux Klan. A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to
004903 the sound produced by cocking a rifle. This terrible secret
004904 society was formed by some ex-Confederate soldiers in the
004905 Southern states after the Civil War, and it rapidly formed local
004906 branches in different parts of the country, notably in Tennessee,
004907 Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida. Its power was
004908 used for political purposes, principally for the terrorising of
004909 the negro voters and the murdering and driving from the country
004910 of those who were opposed to its views. Its outrages were usually
004911 preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic
004912 but generally recognised shape--a sprig of oak-leaves in some
004913 parts, melon seeds or orange pips in others. On receiving this
004914 the victim might either openly abjure his former ways, or might
004915 fly from the country. If he braved the matter out, death would
004916 unfailingly come upon him, and usually in some strange and
004917 unforeseen manner. So perfect was the organisation of the
004918 society, and so systematic its methods, that there is hardly a
004919 case upon record where any man succeeded in braving it with
004920 impunity, or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the
004921 perpetrators. For some years the organisation flourished in spite
004922 of the efforts of the United States government and of the better
004923 classes of the community in the South. Eventually, in the year
004924 1869, the movement rather suddenly collapsed, although there have
004925 been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date.'
004926 
004927 "You will observe," said Holmes, laying down the volume, "that
004928 the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the
004929 disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers. It may
004930 well have been cause and effect. It is no wonder that he and his
004931 family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track.
004932 You can understand that this register and diary may implicate
004933 some of the first men in the South, and that there may be many
004934 who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered."
004935 
004936 "Then the page we have seen--"
004937 
004938 "Is such as we might expect. It ran, if I remember right, 'sent
004939 the pips to A, B, and C'--that is, sent the society's warning to
004940 them. Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared, or
004941 left the country, and finally that C was visited, with, I fear, a
004942 sinister result for C. Well, I think, Doctor, that we may let
004943 some light into this dark place, and I believe that the only
004944 chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have
004945 told him. There is nothing more to be said or to be done
004946 to-night, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for
004947 half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable
004948 ways of our fellow-men."
004949 
004950 
004951 It had cleared in the morning, and the sun was shining with a
004952 subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the
004953 great city. Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came
004954 down.
004955 
004956 "You will excuse me for not waiting for you," said he; "I have, I
004957 foresee, a very busy day before me in looking into this case of
004958 young Openshaw's."
004959 
004960 "What steps will you take?" I asked.
004961 
004962 "It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries.
004963 I may have to go down to Horsham, after all."
004964 
004965 "You will not go there first?"
004966 
004967 "No, I shall commence with the City. Just ring the bell and the
004968 maid will bring up your coffee."
004969 
004970 As I waited, I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and
004971 glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a
004972 chill to my heart.
004973 
004974 "Holmes," I cried, "you are too late."
004975 
004976 "Ah!" said he, laying down his cup, "I feared as much. How was it
004977 done?" He spoke calmly, but I could see that he was deeply moved.
004978 
004979 "My eye caught the name of Openshaw, and the heading 'Tragedy
004980 Near Waterloo Bridge.' Here is the account:
004981 
004982 "Between nine and ten last night Police-Constable Cook, of the H
004983 Division, on duty near Waterloo Bridge, heard a cry for help and
004984 a splash in the water. The night, however, was extremely dark and
004985 stormy, so that, in spite of the help of several passers-by, it
004986 was quite impossible to effect a rescue. The alarm, however, was
004987 given, and, by the aid of the water-police, the body was
004988 eventually recovered. It proved to be that of a young gentleman
004989 whose name, as it appears from an envelope which was found in his
004990 pocket, was John Openshaw, and whose residence is near Horsham.
004991 It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch
004992 the last train from Waterloo Station, and that in his haste and
004993 the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge
004994 of one of the small landing-places for river steamboats. The body
004995 exhibited no traces of violence, and there can be no doubt that
004996 the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident,
004997 which should have the effect of calling the attention of the
004998 authorities to the condition of the riverside landing-stages."
004999 
005000 We sat in silence for some minutes, Holmes more depressed and
005001 shaken than I had ever seen him.
005002 
005003 "That hurts my pride, Watson," he said at last. "It is a petty
005004 feeling, no doubt, but it hurts my pride. It becomes a personal
005005 matter with me now, and, if God sends me health, I shall set my
005006 hand upon this gang. That he should come to me for help, and that
005007 I should send him away to his death--!" He sprang from his chair
005008 and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation, with a
005009 flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and
005010 unclasping of his long thin hands.
005011 
005012 "They must be cunning devils," he exclaimed at last. "How could
005013 they have decoyed him down there? The Embankment is not on the
005014 direct line to the station. The bridge, no doubt, was too
005015 crowded, even on such a night, for their purpose. Well, Watson,
005016 we shall see who will win in the long run. I am going out now!"
005017 
005018 "To the police?"
005019 
005020 "No; I shall be my own police. When I have spun the web they may
005021 take the flies, but not before."
005022 
005023 All day I was engaged in my professional work, and it was late in
005024 the evening before I returned to Baker Street. Sherlock Holmes
005025 had not come back yet. It was nearly ten o'clock before he
005026 entered, looking pale and worn. He walked up to the sideboard,
005027 and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously,
005028 washing it down with a long draught of water.
005029 
005030 "You are hungry," I remarked.
005031 
005032 "Starving. It had escaped my memory. I have had nothing since
005033 breakfast."
005034 
005035 "Nothing?"
005036 
005037 "Not a bite. I had no time to think of it."
005038 
005039 "And how have you succeeded?"
005040 
005041 "Well."
005042 
005043 "You have a clue?"
005044 
005045 "I have them in the hollow of my hand. Young Openshaw shall not
005046 long remain unavenged. Why, Watson, let us put their own devilish
005047 trade-mark upon them. It is well thought of!"
005048 
005049 "What do you mean?"
005050 
005051 He took an orange from the cupboard, and tearing it to pieces he
005052 squeezed out the pips upon the table. Of these he took five and
005053 thrust them into an envelope. On the inside of the flap he wrote
005054 "S. H. for J. O." Then he sealed it and addressed it to "Captain
005055 James Calhoun, Barque 'Lone Star,' Savannah, Georgia."
005056 
005057 "That will await him when he enters port," said he, chuckling.
005058 "It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a
005059 precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him."
005060 
005061 "And who is this Captain Calhoun?"
005062 
005063 "The leader of the gang. I shall have the others, but he first."
005064 
005065 "How did you trace it, then?"
005066 
005067 He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket, all covered with
005068 dates and names.
005069 
005070 "I have spent the whole day," said he, "over Lloyd's registers
005071 and files of the old papers, following the future career of every
005072 vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in
005073 '83. There were thirty-six ships of fair tonnage which were
005074 reported there during those months. Of these, one, the 'Lone Star,'
005075 instantly attracted my attention, since, although it was reported
005076 as having cleared from London, the name is that which is given to
005077 one of the states of the Union."
005078 
005079 "Texas, I think."
005080 
005081 "I was not and am not sure which; but I knew that the ship must
005082 have an American origin."
005083 
005084 "What then?"
005085 
005086 "I searched the Dundee records, and when I found that the barque
005087 'Lone Star' was there in January, '85, my suspicion became a
005088 certainty. I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present
005089 in the port of London."
005090 
005091 "Yes?"
005092 
005093 "The 'Lone Star' had arrived here last week. I went down to the
005094 Albert Dock and found that she had been taken down the river by
005095 the early tide this morning, homeward bound to Savannah. I wired
005096 to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago, and
005097 as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the
005098 Goodwins and not very far from the Isle of Wight."
005099 
005100 "What will you do, then?"
005101 
005102 "Oh, I have my hand upon him. He and the two mates, are as I
005103 learn, the only native-born Americans in the ship. The others are
005104 Finns and Germans. I know, also, that they were all three away
005105 from the ship last night. I had it from the stevedore who has
005106 been loading their cargo. By the time that their sailing-ship
005107 reaches Savannah the mail-boat will have carried this letter, and
005108 the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these
005109 three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder."
005110 
005111 There is ever a flaw, however, in the best laid of human plans,
005112 and the murderers of John Openshaw were never to receive the
005113 orange pips which would show them that another, as cunning and as
005114 resolute as themselves, was upon their track. Very long and very
005115 severe were the equinoctial gales that year. We waited long for
005116 news of the "Lone Star" of Savannah, but none ever reached us. We
005117 did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a
005118 shattered stern-post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough
005119 of a wave, with the letters "L. S." carved upon it, and that is
005120 all which we shall ever know of the fate of the "Lone Star."
005121 
005122 
005123 
005124 ADVENTURE VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
005125 
005126 Isa Whitney, brother of the late Elias Whitney, D.D., Principal
005127 of the Theological College of St. George's, was much addicted to
005128 opium. The habit grew upon him, as I understand, from some
005129 foolish freak when he was at college; for having read De
005130 Quincey's description of his dreams and sensations, he had
005131 drenched his tobacco with laudanum in an attempt to produce the
005132 same effects. He found, as so many more have done, that the
005133 practice is easier to attain than to get rid of, and for many
005134 years he continued to be a slave to the drug, an object of
005135 mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives. I can see
005136 him now, with yellow, pasty face, drooping lids, and pin-point
005137 pupils, all huddled in a chair, the wreck and ruin of a noble
005138 man.
005139 
005140 One night--it was in June, '89--there came a ring to my bell,
005141 about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the
005142 clock. I sat up in my chair, and my wife laid her needle-work
005143 down in her lap and made a little face of disappointment.
005144 
005145 "A patient!" said she. "You'll have to go out."
005146 
005147 I groaned, for I was newly come back from a weary day.
005148 
005149 We heard the door open, a few hurried words, and then quick steps
005150 upon the linoleum. Our own door flew open, and a lady, clad in
005151 some dark-coloured stuff, with a black veil, entered the room.
005152 
005153 "You will excuse my calling so late," she began, and then,
005154 suddenly losing her self-control, she ran forward, threw her arms
005155 about my wife's neck, and sobbed upon her shoulder. "Oh, I'm in
005156 such trouble!" she cried; "I do so want a little help."
005157 
005158 "Why," said my wife, pulling up her veil, "it is Kate Whitney.
005159 How you startled me, Kate! I had not an idea who you were when
005160 you came in."
005161 
005162 "I didn't know what to do, so I came straight to you." That was
005163 always the way. Folk who were in grief came to my wife like birds
005164 to a light-house.
005165 
005166 "It was very sweet of you to come. Now, you must have some wine
005167 and water, and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it. Or
005168 should you rather that I sent James off to bed?"
005169 
005170 "Oh, no, no! I want the doctor's advice and help, too. It's about
005171 Isa. He has not been home for two days. I am so frightened about
005172 him!"
005173 
005174 It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her
005175 husband's trouble, to me as a doctor, to my wife as an old friend
005176 and school companion. We soothed and comforted her by such words
005177 as we could find. Did she know where her husband was? Was it
005178 possible that we could bring him back to her?
005179 
005180 It seems that it was. She had the surest information that of late
005181 he had, when the fit was on him, made use of an opium den in the
005182 farthest east of the City. Hitherto his orgies had always been
005183 confined to one day, and he had come back, twitching and
005184 shattered, in the evening. But now the spell had been upon him
005185 eight-and-forty hours, and he lay there, doubtless among the
005186 dregs of the docks, breathing in the poison or sleeping off the
005187 effects. There he was to be found, she was sure of it, at the Bar
005188 of Gold, in Upper Swandam Lane. But what was she to do? How could
005189 she, a young and timid woman, make her way into such a place and
005190 pluck her husband out from among the ruffians who surrounded him?
005191 
005192 There was the case, and of course there was but one way out of
005193 it. Might I not escort her to this place? And then, as a second
005194 thought, why should she come at all? I was Isa Whitney's medical
005195 adviser, and as such I had influence over him. I could manage it
005196 better if I were alone. I promised her on my word that I would
005197 send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the
005198 address which she had given me. And so in ten minutes I had left
005199 my armchair and cheery sitting-room behind me, and was speeding
005200 eastward in a hansom on a strange errand, as it seemed to me at
005201 the time, though the future only could show how strange it was to
005202 be.
005203 
005204 But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my
005205 adventure. Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the
005206 high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east
005207 of London Bridge. Between a slop-shop and a gin-shop, approached
005208 by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the
005209 mouth of a cave, I found the den of which I was in search.
005210 Ordering my cab to wait, I passed down the steps, worn hollow in
005211 the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet; and by the
005212 light of a flickering oil-lamp above the door I found the latch
005213 and made my way into a long, low room, thick and heavy with the
005214 brown opium smoke, and terraced with wooden berths, like the
005215 forecastle of an emigrant ship.
005216 
005217 Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying
005218 in strange fantastic poses, bowed shoulders, bent knees, heads
005219 thrown back, and chins pointing upward, with here and there a
005220 dark, lack-lustre eye turned upon the newcomer. Out of the black
005221 shadows there glimmered little red circles of light, now bright,
005222 now faint, as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of
005223 the metal pipes. The most lay silent, but some muttered to
005224 themselves, and others talked together in a strange, low,
005225 monotonous voice, their conversation coming in gushes, and then
005226 suddenly tailing off into silence, each mumbling out his own
005227 thoughts and paying little heed to the words of his neighbour. At
005228 the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal, beside
005229 which on a three-legged wooden stool there sat a tall, thin old
005230 man, with his jaw resting upon his two fists, and his elbows upon
005231 his knees, staring into the fire.
005232 
005233 As I entered, a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe
005234 for me and a supply of the drug, beckoning me to an empty berth.
005235 
005236 "Thank you. I have not come to stay," said I. "There is a friend
005237 of mine here, Mr. Isa Whitney, and I wish to speak with him."
005238 
005239 There was a movement and an exclamation from my right, and
005240 peering through the gloom, I saw Whitney, pale, haggard, and
005241 unkempt, staring out at me.
005242 
005243 "My God! It's Watson," said he. He was in a pitiable state of
005244 reaction, with every nerve in a twitter. "I say, Watson, what
005245 o'clock is it?"
005246 
005247 "Nearly eleven."
005248 
005249 "Of what day?"
005250 
005251 "Of Friday, June 19th."
005252 
005253 "Good heavens! I thought it was Wednesday. It is Wednesday. What
005254 d'you want to frighten a chap for?" He sank his face onto his
005255 arms and began to sob in a high treble key.
005256 
005257 "I tell you that it is Friday, man. Your wife has been waiting
005258 this two days for you. You should be ashamed of yourself!"
005259 
005260 "So I am. But you've got mixed, Watson, for I have only been here
005261 a few hours, three pipes, four pipes--I forget how many. But I'll
005262 go home with you. I wouldn't frighten Kate--poor little Kate.
005263 Give me your hand! Have you a cab?"
005264 
005265 "Yes, I have one waiting."
005266 
005267 "Then I shall go in it. But I must owe something. Find what I
005268 owe, Watson. I am all off colour. I can do nothing for myself."
005269 
005270 I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of
005271 sleepers, holding my breath to keep out the vile, stupefying
005272 fumes of the drug, and looking about for the manager. As I passed
005273 the tall man who sat by the brazier I felt a sudden pluck at my
005274 skirt, and a low voice whispered, "Walk past me, and then look
005275 back at me." The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear. I
005276 glanced down. They could only have come from the old man at my
005277 side, and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever, very thin, very
005278 wrinkled, bent with age, an opium pipe dangling down from between
005279 his knees, as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his
005280 fingers. I took two steps forward and looked back. It took all my
005281 self-control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of
005282 astonishment. He had turned his back so that none could see him
005283 but I. His form had filled out, his wrinkles were gone, the dull
005284 eyes had regained their fire, and there, sitting by the fire and
005285 grinning at my surprise, was none other than Sherlock Holmes. He
005286 made a slight motion to me to approach him, and instantly, as he
005287 turned his face half round to the company once more, subsided
005288 into a doddering, loose-lipped senility.
005289 
005290 "Holmes!" I whispered, "what on earth are you doing in this den?"
005291 
005292 "As low as you can," he answered; "I have excellent ears. If you
005293 would have the great kindness to get rid of that sottish friend
005294 of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with
005295 you."
005296 
005297 "I have a cab outside."
005298 
005299 "Then pray send him home in it. You may safely trust him, for he
005300 appears to be too limp to get into any mischief. I should
005301 recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to
005302 say that you have thrown in your lot with me. If you will wait
005303 outside, I shall be with you in five minutes."
005304 
005305 It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes' requests, for
005306 they were always so exceedingly definite, and put forward with
005307 such a quiet air of mastery. I felt, however, that when Whitney
005308 was once confined in the cab my mission was practically
005309 accomplished; and for the rest, I could not wish anything better
005310 than to be associated with my friend in one of those singular
005311 adventures which were the normal condition of his existence. In a
005312 few minutes I had written my note, paid Whitney's bill, led him
005313 out to the cab, and seen him driven through the darkness. In a
005314 very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den,
005315 and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes. For two
005316 streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot.
005317 Then, glancing quickly round, he straightened himself out and
005318 burst into a hearty fit of laughter.
005319 
005320 "I suppose, Watson," said he, "that you imagine that I have added
005321 opium-smoking to cocaine injections, and all the other little
005322 weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical
005323 views."
005324 
005325 "I was certainly surprised to find you there."
005326 
005327 "But not more so than I to find you."
005328 
005329 "I came to find a friend."
005330 
005331 "And I to find an enemy."
005332 
005333 "An enemy?"
005334 
005335 "Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural
005336 prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable
005337 inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent
005338 ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been
005339 recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an
005340 hour's purchase; for I have used it before now for my own
005341 purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have
005342 vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that
005343 building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some
005344 strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless
005345 nights."
005346 
005347 "What! You do not mean bodies?"
005348 
005349 "Ay, bodies, Watson. We should be rich men if we had 1000 pounds
005350 for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den. It
005351 is the vilest murder-trap on the whole riverside, and I fear that
005352 Neville St. Clair has entered it never to leave it more. But our
005353 trap should be here." He put his two forefingers between his
005354 teeth and whistled shrilly--a signal which was answered by a
005355 similar whistle from the distance, followed shortly by the rattle
005356 of wheels and the clink of horses' hoofs.
005357 
005358 "Now, Watson," said Holmes, as a tall dog-cart dashed up through
005359 the gloom, throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from
005360 its side lanterns. "You'll come with me, won't you?"
005361 
005362 "If I can be of use."
005363 
005364 "Oh, a trusty comrade is always of use; and a chronicler still
005365 more so. My room at The Cedars is a double-bedded one."
005366 
005367 "The Cedars?"
005368 
005369 "Yes; that is Mr. St. Clair's house. I am staying there while I
005370 conduct the inquiry."
005371 
005372 "Where is it, then?"
005373 
005374 "Near Lee, in Kent. We have a seven-mile drive before us."
005375 
005376 "But I am all in the dark."
005377 
005378 "Of course you are. You'll know all about it presently. Jump up
005379 here. All right, John; we shall not need you. Here's half a
005380 crown. Look out for me to-morrow, about eleven. Give her her
005381 head. So long, then!"
005382 
005383 He flicked the horse with his whip, and we dashed away through
005384 the endless succession of sombre and deserted streets, which
005385 widened gradually, until we were flying across a broad
005386 balustraded bridge, with the murky river flowing sluggishly
005387 beneath us. Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and
005388 mortar, its silence broken only by the heavy, regular footfall of
005389 the policeman, or the songs and shouts of some belated party of
005390 revellers. A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky, and a
005391 star or two twinkled dimly here and there through the rifts of
005392 the clouds. Holmes drove in silence, with his head sunk upon his
005393 breast, and the air of a man who is lost in thought, while I sat
005394 beside him, curious to learn what this new quest might be which
005395 seemed to tax his powers so sorely, and yet afraid to break in
005396 upon the current of his thoughts. We had driven several miles,
005397 and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban
005398 villas, when he shook himself, shrugged his shoulders, and lit up
005399 his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he
005400 is acting for the best.
005401 
005402 "You have a grand gift of silence, Watson," said he. "It makes
005403 you quite invaluable as a companion. 'Pon my word, it is a great
005404 thing for me to have someone to talk to, for my own thoughts are
005405 not over-pleasant. I was wondering what I should say to this dear
005406 little woman to-night when she meets me at the door."
005407 
005408 "You forget that I know nothing about it."
005409 
005410 "I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before
005411 we get to Lee. It seems absurdly simple, and yet, somehow I can
005412 get nothing to go upon. There's plenty of thread, no doubt, but I
005413 can't get the end of it into my hand. Now, I'll state the case
005414 clearly and concisely to you, Watson, and maybe you can see a
005415 spark where all is dark to me."
005416 
005417 "Proceed, then."
005418 
005419 "Some years ago--to be definite, in May, 1884--there came to Lee
005420 a gentleman, Neville St. Clair by name, who appeared to have
005421 plenty of money. He took a large villa, laid out the grounds very
005422 nicely, and lived generally in good style. By degrees he made
005423 friends in the neighbourhood, and in 1887 he married the daughter
005424 of a local brewer, by whom he now has two children. He had no
005425 occupation, but was interested in several companies and went into
005426 town as a rule in the morning, returning by the 5:14 from Cannon
005427 Street every night. Mr. St. Clair is now thirty-seven years of
005428 age, is a man of temperate habits, a good husband, a very
005429 affectionate father, and a man who is popular with all who know
005430 him. I may add that his whole debts at the present moment, as far
005431 as we have been able to ascertain, amount to 88 pounds 10s., while
005432 he has 220 pounds standing to his credit in the Capital and
005433 Counties Bank. There is no reason, therefore, to think that money
005434 troubles have been weighing upon his mind.
005435 
005436 "Last Monday Mr. Neville St. Clair went into town rather earlier
005437 than usual, remarking before he started that he had two important
005438 commissions to perform, and that he would bring his little boy
005439 home a box of bricks. Now, by the merest chance, his wife
005440 received a telegram upon this same Monday, very shortly after his
005441 departure, to the effect that a small parcel of considerable
005442 value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the
005443 offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company. Now, if you are well up
005444 in your London, you will know that the office of the company is
005445 in Fresno Street, which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane, where
005446 you found me to-night. Mrs. St. Clair had her lunch, started for
005447 the City, did some shopping, proceeded to the company's office,
005448 got her packet, and found herself at exactly 4:35 walking through
005449 Swandam Lane on her way back to the station. Have you followed me
005450 so far?"
005451 
005452 "It is very clear."
005453 
005454 "If you remember, Monday was an exceedingly hot day, and Mrs. St.
005455 Clair walked slowly, glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab,
005456 as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself.
005457 While she was walking in this way down Swandam Lane, she suddenly
005458 heard an ejaculation or cry, and was struck cold to see her
005459 husband looking down at her and, as it seemed to her, beckoning
005460 to her from a second-floor window. The window was open, and she
005461 distinctly saw his face, which she describes as being terribly
005462 agitated. He waved his hands frantically to her, and then
005463 vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that
005464 he had been plucked back by some irresistible force from behind.
005465 One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that
005466 although he wore some dark coat, such as he had started to town
005467 in, he had on neither collar nor necktie.
005468 
005469 "Convinced that something was amiss with him, she rushed down the
005470 steps--for the house was none other than the opium den in which
005471 you found me to-night--and running through the front room she
005472 attempted to ascend the stairs which led to the first floor. At
005473 the foot of the stairs, however, she met this Lascar scoundrel of
005474 whom I have spoken, who thrust her back and, aided by a Dane, who
005475 acts as assistant there, pushed her out into the street. Filled
005476 with the most maddening doubts and fears, she rushed down the
005477 lane and, by rare good-fortune, met in Fresno Street a number of
005478 constables with an inspector, all on their way to their beat. The
005479 inspector and two men accompanied her back, and in spite of the
005480 continued resistance of the proprietor, they made their way to
005481 the room in which Mr. St. Clair had last been seen. There was no
005482 sign of him there. In fact, in the whole of that floor there was
005483 no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect, who,
005484 it seems, made his home there. Both he and the Lascar stoutly
005485 swore that no one else had been in the front room during the
005486 afternoon. So determined was their denial that the inspector was
005487 staggered, and had almost come to believe that Mrs. St. Clair had
005488 been deluded when, with a cry, she sprang at a small deal box
005489 which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it. Out there fell
005490 a cascade of children's bricks. It was the toy which he had
005491 promised to bring home.
005492 
005493 "This discovery, and the evident confusion which the cripple
005494 showed, made the inspector realise that the matter was serious.
005495 The rooms were carefully examined, and results all pointed to an
005496 abominable crime. The front room was plainly furnished as a
005497 sitting-room and led into a small bedroom, which looked out upon
005498 the back of one of the wharves. Between the wharf and the bedroom
005499 window is a narrow strip, which is dry at low tide but is covered
005500 at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water. The
005501 bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below. On
005502 examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill,
005503 and several scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of
005504 the bedroom. Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were
005505 all the clothes of Mr. Neville St. Clair, with the exception of
005506 his coat. His boots, his socks, his hat, and his watch--all were
005507 there. There were no signs of violence upon any of these
005508 garments, and there were no other traces of Mr. Neville St.
005509 Clair. Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no
005510 other exit could be discovered, and the ominous bloodstains upon
005511 the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by
005512 swimming, for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of
005513 the tragedy.
005514 
005515 "And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately
005516 implicated in the matter. The Lascar was known to be a man of the
005517 vilest antecedents, but as, by Mrs. St. Clair's story, he was
005518 known to have been at the foot of the stair within a very few
005519 seconds of her husband's appearance at the window, he could
005520 hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime. His defence
005521 was one of absolute ignorance, and he protested that he had no
005522 knowledge as to the doings of Hugh Boone, his lodger, and that he
005523 could not account in any way for the presence of the missing
005524 gentleman's clothes.
005525 
005526 "So much for the Lascar manager. Now for the sinister cripple who
005527 lives upon the second floor of the opium den, and who was
005528 certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St.
005529 Clair. His name is Hugh Boone, and his hideous face is one which
005530 is familiar to every man who goes much to the City. He is a
005531 professional beggar, though in order to avoid the police
005532 regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas. Some
005533 little distance down Threadneedle Street, upon the left-hand
005534 side, there is, as you may have remarked, a small angle in the
005535 wall. Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat,
005536 cross-legged with his tiny stock of matches on his lap, and as he
005537 is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the
005538 greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him. I
005539 have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of
005540 making his professional acquaintance, and I have been surprised
005541 at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time. His
005542 appearance, you see, is so remarkable that no one can pass him
005543 without observing him. A shock of orange hair, a pale face
005544 disfigured by a horrible scar, which, by its contraction, has
005545 turned up the outer edge of his upper lip, a bulldog chin, and a
005546 pair of very penetrating dark eyes, which present a singular
005547 contrast to the colour of his hair, all mark him out from amid
005548 the common crowd of mendicants and so, too, does his wit, for he
005549 is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be
005550 thrown at him by the passers-by. This is the man whom we now
005551 learn to have been the lodger at the opium den, and to have been
005552 the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest."
005553 
005554 "But a cripple!" said I. "What could he have done single-handed
005555 against a man in the prime of life?"
005556 
005557 "He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp; but in
005558 other respects he appears to be a powerful and well-nurtured man.
005559 Surely your medical experience would tell you, Watson, that
005560 weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional
005561 strength in the others."
005562 
005563 "Pray continue your narrative."
005564 
005565 "Mrs. St. Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the
005566 window, and she was escorted home in a cab by the police, as her
005567 presence could be of no help to them in their investigations.
005568 Inspector Barton, who had charge of the case, made a very careful
005569 examination of the premises, but without finding anything which
005570 threw any light upon the matter. One mistake had been made in not
005571 arresting Boone instantly, as he was allowed some few minutes
005572 during which he might have communicated with his friend the
005573 Lascar, but this fault was soon remedied, and he was seized and
005574 searched, without anything being found which could incriminate
005575 him. There were, it is true, some blood-stains upon his right
005576 shirt-sleeve, but he pointed to his ring-finger, which had been
005577 cut near the nail, and explained that the bleeding came from
005578 there, adding that he had been to the window not long before, and
005579 that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from
005580 the same source. He denied strenuously having ever seen Mr.
005581 Neville St. Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in
005582 his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police. As to
005583 Mrs. St. Clair's assertion that she had actually seen her husband
005584 at the window, he declared that she must have been either mad or
005585 dreaming. He was removed, loudly protesting, to the
005586 police-station, while the inspector remained upon the premises in
005587 the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some fresh clue.
005588 
005589 "And it did, though they hardly found upon the mud-bank what they
005590 had feared to find. It was Neville St. Clair's coat, and not
005591 Neville St. Clair, which lay uncovered as the tide receded. And
005592 what do you think they found in the pockets?"
005593 
005594 "I cannot imagine."
005595 
005596 "No, I don't think you would guess. Every pocket stuffed with
005597 pennies and half-pennies--421 pennies and 270 half-pennies. It
005598 was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide. But a
005599 human body is a different matter. There is a fierce eddy between
005600 the wharf and the house. It seemed likely enough that the
005601 weighted coat had remained when the stripped body had been sucked
005602 away into the river."
005603 
005604 "But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the
005605 room. Would the body be dressed in a coat alone?"
005606 
005607 "No, sir, but the facts might be met speciously enough. Suppose
005608 that this man Boone had thrust Neville St. Clair through the
005609 window, there is no human eye which could have seen the deed.
005610 What would he do then? It would of course instantly strike him
005611 that he must get rid of the tell-tale garments. He would seize
005612 the coat, then, and be in the act of throwing it out, when it
005613 would occur to him that it would swim and not sink. He has little
005614 time, for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried
005615 to force her way up, and perhaps he has already heard from his
005616 Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street.
005617 There is not an instant to be lost. He rushes to some secret
005618 hoard, where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary, and he
005619 stuffs all the coins upon which he can lay his hands into the
005620 pockets to make sure of the coat's sinking. He throws it out, and
005621 would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard
005622 the rush of steps below, and only just had time to close the
005623 window when the police appeared."
005624 
005625 "It certainly sounds feasible."
005626 
005627 "Well, we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a
005628 better. Boone, as I have told you, was arrested and taken to the
005629 station, but it could not be shown that there had ever before
005630 been anything against him. He had for years been known as a
005631 professional beggar, but his life appeared to have been a very
005632 quiet and innocent one. There the matter stands at present, and
005633 the questions which have to be solved--what Neville St. Clair was
005634 doing in the opium den, what happened to him when there, where is
005635 he now, and what Hugh Boone had to do with his disappearance--are
005636 all as far from a solution as ever. I confess that I cannot
005637 recall any case within my experience which looked at the first
005638 glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties."
005639 
005640 While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of
005641 events, we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great
005642 town until the last straggling houses had been left behind, and
005643 we rattled along with a country hedge upon either side of us.
005644 Just as he finished, however, we drove through two scattered
005645 villages, where a few lights still glimmered in the windows.
005646 
005647 "We are on the outskirts of Lee," said my companion. "We have
005648 touched on three English counties in our short drive, starting in
005649 Middlesex, passing over an angle of Surrey, and ending in Kent.
005650 See that light among the trees? That is The Cedars, and beside
005651 that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already, I have
005652 little doubt, caught the clink of our horse's feet."
005653 
005654 "But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street?" I
005655 asked.
005656 
005657 "Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here.
005658 Mrs. St. Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal, and
005659 you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for
005660 my friend and colleague. I hate to meet her, Watson, when I have
005661 no news of her husband. Here we are. Whoa, there, whoa!"
005662 
005663 We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its
005664 own grounds. A stable-boy had run out to the horse's head, and
005665 springing down, I followed Holmes up the small, winding
005666 gravel-drive which led to the house. As we approached, the door
005667 flew open, and a little blonde woman stood in the opening, clad
005668 in some sort of light mousseline de soie, with a touch of fluffy
005669 pink chiffon at her neck and wrists. She stood with her figure
005670 outlined against the flood of light, one hand upon the door, one
005671 half-raised in her eagerness, her body slightly bent, her head
005672 and face protruded, with eager eyes and parted lips, a standing
005673 question.
005674 
005675 "Well?" she cried, "well?" And then, seeing that there were two
005676 of us, she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw
005677 that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.
005678 
005679 "No good news?"
005680 
005681 "None."
005682 
005683 "No bad?"
005684 
005685 "No."
005686 
005687 "Thank God for that. But come in. You must be weary, for you have
005688 had a long day."
005689 
005690 "This is my friend, Dr. Watson. He has been of most vital use to
005691 me in several of my cases, and a lucky chance has made it
005692 possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this
005693 investigation."
005694 
005695 "I am delighted to see you," said she, pressing my hand warmly.
005696 "You will, I am sure, forgive anything that may be wanting in our
005697 arrangements, when you consider the blow which has come so
005698 suddenly upon us."
005699 
005700 "My dear madam," said I, "I am an old campaigner, and if I were
005701 not I can very well see that no apology is needed. If I can be of
005702 any assistance, either to you or to my friend here, I shall be
005703 indeed happy."
005704 
005705 "Now, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said the lady as we entered a
005706 well-lit dining-room, upon the table of which a cold supper had
005707 been laid out, "I should very much like to ask you one or two
005708 plain questions, to which I beg that you will give a plain
005709 answer."
005710 
005711 "Certainly, madam."
005712 
005713 "Do not trouble about my feelings. I am not hysterical, nor given
005714 to fainting. I simply wish to hear your real, real opinion."
005715 
005716 "Upon what point?"
005717 
005718 "In your heart of hearts, do you think that Neville is alive?"
005719 
005720 Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question.
005721 "Frankly, now!" she repeated, standing upon the rug and looking
005722 keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket-chair.
005723 
005724 "Frankly, then, madam, I do not."
005725 
005726 "You think that he is dead?"
005727 
005728 "I do."
005729 
005730 "Murdered?"
005731 
005732 "I don't say that. Perhaps."
005733 
005734 "And on what day did he meet his death?"
005735 
005736 "On Monday."
005737 
005738 "Then perhaps, Mr. Holmes, you will be good enough to explain how
005739 it is that I have received a letter from him to-day."
005740 
005741 Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been
005742 galvanised.
005743 
005744 "What!" he roared.
005745 
005746 "Yes, to-day." She stood smiling, holding up a little slip of
005747 paper in the air.
005748 
005749 "May I see it?"
005750 
005751 "Certainly."
005752 
005753 He snatched it from her in his eagerness, and smoothing it out
005754 upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently. I
005755 had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder. The
005756 envelope was a very coarse one and was stamped with the Gravesend
005757 postmark and with the date of that very day, or rather of the day
005758 before, for it was considerably after midnight.
005759 
005760 "Coarse writing," murmured Holmes. "Surely this is not your
005761 husband's writing, madam."
005762 
005763 "No, but the enclosure is."
005764 
005765 "I perceive also that whoever addressed the envelope had to go
005766 and inquire as to the address."
005767 
005768 "How can you tell that?"
005769 
005770 "The name, you see, is in perfectly black ink, which has dried
005771 itself. The rest is of the greyish colour, which shows that
005772 blotting-paper has been used. If it had been written straight
005773 off, and then blotted, none would be of a deep black shade. This
005774 man has written the name, and there has then been a pause before
005775 he wrote the address, which can only mean that he was not
005776 familiar with it. It is, of course, a trifle, but there is
005777 nothing so important as trifles. Let us now see the letter. Ha!
005778 there has been an enclosure here!"
005779 
005780 "Yes, there was a ring. His signet-ring."
005781 
005782 "And you are sure that this is your husband's hand?"
005783 
005784 "One of his hands."
005785 
005786 "One?"
005787 
005788 "His hand when he wrote hurriedly. It is very unlike his usual
005789 writing, and yet I know it well."
005790 
005791 "'Dearest do not be frightened. All will come well. There is a
005792 huge error which it may take some little time to rectify.
005793 Wait in patience.--NEVILLE.' Written in pencil upon the fly-leaf
005794 of a book, octavo size, no water-mark. Hum! Posted to-day in
005795 Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb. Ha! And the flap has been
005796 gummed, if I am not very much in error, by a person who had been
005797 chewing tobacco. And you have no doubt that it is your husband's
005798 hand, madam?"
005799 
005800 "None. Neville wrote those words."
005801 
005802 "And they were posted to-day at Gravesend. Well, Mrs. St. Clair,
005803 the clouds lighten, though I should not venture to say that the
005804 danger is over."
005805 
005806 "But he must be alive, Mr. Holmes."
005807 
005808 "Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent.
005809 The ring, after all, proves nothing. It may have been taken from
005810 him."
005811 
005812 "No, no; it is, it is his very own writing!"
005813 
005814 "Very well. It may, however, have been written on Monday and only
005815 posted to-day."
005816 
005817 "That is possible."
005818 
005819 "If so, much may have happened between."
005820 
005821 "Oh, you must not discourage me, Mr. Holmes. I know that all is
005822 well with him. There is so keen a sympathy between us that I
005823 should know if evil came upon him. On the very day that I saw him
005824 last he cut himself in the bedroom, and yet I in the dining-room
005825 rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that
005826 something had happened. Do you think that I would respond to such
005827 a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death?"
005828 
005829 "I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman
005830 may be more valuable than the conclusion of an analytical
005831 reasoner. And in this letter you certainly have a very strong
005832 piece of evidence to corroborate your view. But if your husband
005833 is alive and able to write letters, why should he remain away
005834 from you?"
005835 
005836 "I cannot imagine. It is unthinkable."
005837 
005838 "And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you?"
005839 
005840 "No."
005841 
005842 "And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane?"
005843 
005844 "Very much so."
005845 
005846 "Was the window open?"
005847 
005848 "Yes."
005849 
005850 "Then he might have called to you?"
005851 
005852 "He might."
005853 
005854 "He only, as I understand, gave an inarticulate cry?"
005855 
005856 "Yes."
005857 
005858 "A call for help, you thought?"
005859 
005860 "Yes. He waved his hands."
005861 
005862 "But it might have been a cry of surprise. Astonishment at the
005863 unexpected sight of you might cause him to throw up his hands?"
005864 
005865 "It is possible."
005866 
005867 "And you thought he was pulled back?"
005868 
005869 "He disappeared so suddenly."
005870 
005871 "He might have leaped back. You did not see anyone else in the
005872 room?"
005873 
005874 "No, but this horrible man confessed to having been there, and
005875 the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs."
005876 
005877 "Quite so. Your husband, as far as you could see, had his
005878 ordinary clothes on?"
005879 
005880 "But without his collar or tie. I distinctly saw his bare
005881 throat."
005882 
005883 "Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane?"
005884 
005885 "Never."
005886 
005887 "Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium?"
005888 
005889 "Never."
005890 
005891 "Thank you, Mrs. St. Clair. Those are the principal points about
005892 which I wished to be absolutely clear. We shall now have a little
005893 supper and then retire, for we may have a very busy day
005894 to-morrow."
005895 
005896 A large and comfortable double-bedded room had been placed at our
005897 disposal, and I was quickly between the sheets, for I was weary
005898 after my night of adventure. Sherlock Holmes was a man, however,
005899 who, when he had an unsolved problem upon his mind, would go for
005900 days, and even for a week, without rest, turning it over,
005901 rearranging his facts, looking at it from every point of view
005902 until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself that his
005903 data were insufficient. It was soon evident to me that he was now
005904 preparing for an all-night sitting. He took off his coat and
005905 waistcoat, put on a large blue dressing-gown, and then wandered
005906 about the room collecting pillows from his bed and cushions from
005907 the sofa and armchairs. With these he constructed a sort of
005908 Eastern divan, upon which he perched himself cross-legged, with
005909 an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out in front
005910 of him. In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there, an
005911 old briar pipe between his lips, his eyes fixed vacantly upon the
005912 corner of the ceiling, the blue smoke curling up from him,
005913 silent, motionless, with the light shining upon his strong-set
005914 aquiline features. So he sat as I dropped off to sleep, and so he
005915 sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up, and I found
005916 the summer sun shining into the apartment. The pipe was still
005917 between his lips, the smoke still curled upward, and the room was
005918 full of a dense tobacco haze, but nothing remained of the heap of
005919 shag which I had seen upon the previous night.
005920 
005921 "Awake, Watson?" he asked.
005922 
005923 "Yes."
005924 
005925 "Game for a morning drive?"
005926 
005927 "Certainly."
005928 
005929 "Then dress. No one is stirring yet, but I know where the
005930 stable-boy sleeps, and we shall soon have the trap out." He
005931 chuckled to himself as he spoke, his eyes twinkled, and he seemed
005932 a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night.
005933 
005934 As I dressed I glanced at my watch. It was no wonder that no one
005935 was stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly
005936 finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was
005937 putting in the horse.
005938 
005939 "I want to test a little theory of mine," said he, pulling on his
005940 boots. "I think, Watson, that you are now standing in the
005941 presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe. I deserve
005942 to be kicked from here to Charing Cross. But I think I have the
005943 key of the affair now."
005944 
005945 "And where is it?" I asked, smiling.
005946 
005947 "In the bathroom," he answered. "Oh, yes, I am not joking," he
005948 continued, seeing my look of incredulity. "I have just been
005949 there, and I have taken it out, and I have got it in this
005950 Gladstone bag. Come on, my boy, and we shall see whether it will
005951 not fit the lock."
005952 
005953 We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible, and out into
005954 the bright morning sunshine. In the road stood our horse and
005955 trap, with the half-clad stable-boy waiting at the head. We both
005956 sprang in, and away we dashed down the London Road. A few country
005957 carts were stirring, bearing in vegetables to the metropolis, but
005958 the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as
005959 some city in a dream.
005960 
005961 "It has been in some points a singular case," said Holmes,
005962 flicking the horse on into a gallop. "I confess that I have been
005963 as blind as a mole, but it is better to learn wisdom late than
005964 never to learn it at all."
005965 
005966 In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily
005967 from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey
005968 side. Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the
005969 river, and dashing up Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the
005970 right and found ourselves in Bow Street. Sherlock Holmes was well
005971 known to the force, and the two constables at the door saluted
005972 him. One of them held the horse's head while the other led us in.
005973 
005974 "Who is on duty?" asked Holmes.
005975 
005976 "Inspector Bradstreet, sir."
005977 
005978 "Ah, Bradstreet, how are you?" A tall, stout official had come
005979 down the stone-flagged passage, in a peaked cap and frogged
005980 jacket. "I wish to have a quiet word with you, Bradstreet."
005981 "Certainly, Mr. Holmes. Step into my room here." It was a small,
005982 office-like room, with a huge ledger upon the table, and a
005983 telephone projecting from the wall. The inspector sat down at his
005984 desk.
005985 
005986 "What can I do for you, Mr. Holmes?"
005987 
005988 "I called about that beggarman, Boone--the one who was charged
005989 with being concerned in the disappearance of Mr. Neville St.
005990 Clair, of Lee."
005991 
005992 "Yes. He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries."
005993 
005994 "So I heard. You have him here?"
005995 
005996 "In the cells."
005997 
005998 "Is he quiet?"
005999 
006000 "Oh, he gives no trouble. But he is a dirty scoundrel."
006001 
006002 "Dirty?"
006003 
006004 "Yes, it is all we can do to make him wash his hands, and his
006005 face is as black as a tinker's. Well, when once his case has been
006006 settled, he will have a regular prison bath; and I think, if you
006007 saw him, you would agree with me that he needed it."
006008 
006009 "I should like to see him very much."
006010 
006011 "Would you? That is easily done. Come this way. You can leave
006012 your bag."
006013 
006014 "No, I think that I'll take it."
006015 
006016 "Very good. Come this way, if you please." He led us down a
006017 passage, opened a barred door, passed down a winding stair, and
006018 brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each
006019 side.
006020 
006021 "The third on the right is his," said the inspector. "Here it
006022 is!" He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door
006023 and glanced through.
006024 
006025 "He is asleep," said he. "You can see him very well."
006026 
006027 We both put our eyes to the grating. The prisoner lay with his
006028 face towards us, in a very deep sleep, breathing slowly and
006029 heavily. He was a middle-sized man, coarsely clad as became his
006030 calling, with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his
006031 tattered coat. He was, as the inspector had said, extremely
006032 dirty, but the grime which covered his face could not conceal its
006033 repulsive ugliness. A broad wheal from an old scar ran right
006034 across it from eye to chin, and by its contraction had turned up
006035 one side of the upper lip, so that three teeth were exposed in a
006036 perpetual snarl. A shock of very bright red hair grew low over
006037 his eyes and forehead.
006038 
006039 "He's a beauty, isn't he?" said the inspector.
006040 
006041 "He certainly needs a wash," remarked Holmes. "I had an idea that
006042 he might, and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me."
006043 He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke, and took out, to my
006044 astonishment, a very large bath-sponge.
006045 
006046 "He! he! You are a funny one," chuckled the inspector.
006047 
006048 "Now, if you will have the great goodness to open that door very
006049 quietly, we will soon make him cut a much more respectable
006050 figure."
006051 
006052 "Well, I don't know why not," said the inspector. "He doesn't
006053 look a credit to the Bow Street cells, does he?" He slipped his
006054 key into the lock, and we all very quietly entered the cell. The
006055 sleeper half turned, and then settled down once more into a deep
006056 slumber. Holmes stooped to the water-jug, moistened his sponge,
006057 and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the
006058 prisoner's face.
006059 
006060 "Let me introduce you," he shouted, "to Mr. Neville St. Clair, of
006061 Lee, in the county of Kent."
006062 
006063 Never in my life have I seen such a sight. The man's face peeled
006064 off under the sponge like the bark from a tree. Gone was the
006065 coarse brown tint! Gone, too, was the horrid scar which had
006066 seamed it across, and the twisted lip which had given the
006067 repulsive sneer to the face! A twitch brought away the tangled
006068 red hair, and there, sitting up in his bed, was a pale,
006069 sad-faced, refined-looking man, black-haired and smooth-skinned,
006070 rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment.
006071 Then suddenly realising the exposure, he broke into a scream and
006072 threw himself down with his face to the pillow.
006073 
006074 "Great heavens!" cried the inspector, "it is, indeed, the missing
006075 man. I know him from the photograph."
006076 
006077 The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons
006078 himself to his destiny. "Be it so," said he. "And pray what am I
006079 charged with?"
006080 
006081 "With making away with Mr. Neville St.-- Oh, come, you can't be
006082 charged with that unless they make a case of attempted suicide of
006083 it," said the inspector with a grin. "Well, I have been
006084 twenty-seven years in the force, but this really takes the cake."
006085 
006086 "If I am Mr. Neville St. Clair, then it is obvious that no crime
006087 has been committed, and that, therefore, I am illegally
006088 detained."
006089 
006090 "No crime, but a very great error has been committed," said
006091 Holmes. "You would have done better to have trusted your wife."
006092 
006093 "It was not the wife; it was the children," groaned the prisoner.
006094 "God help me, I would not have them ashamed of their father. My
006095 God! What an exposure! What can I do?"
006096 
006097 Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him
006098 kindly on the shoulder.
006099 
006100 "If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up," said
006101 he, "of course you can hardly avoid publicity. On the other hand,
006102 if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible
006103 case against you, I do not know that there is any reason that the
006104 details should find their way into the papers. Inspector
006105 Bradstreet would, I am sure, make notes upon anything which you
006106 might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities. The case
006107 would then never go into court at all."
006108 
006109 "God bless you!" cried the prisoner passionately. "I would have
006110 endured imprisonment, ay, even execution, rather than have left
006111 my miserable secret as a family blot to my children.
006112 
006113 "You are the first who have ever heard my story. My father was a
006114 schoolmaster in Chesterfield, where I received an excellent
006115 education. I travelled in my youth, took to the stage, and
006116 finally became a reporter on an evening paper in London. One day
006117 my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the
006118 metropolis, and I volunteered to supply them. There was the point
006119 from which all my adventures started. It was only by trying
006120 begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to
006121 base my articles. When an actor I had, of course, learned all the
006122 secrets of making up, and had been famous in the green-room for
006123 my skill. I took advantage now of my attainments. I painted my
006124 face, and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good
006125 scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a
006126 small slip of flesh-coloured plaster. Then with a red head of
006127 hair, and an appropriate dress, I took my station in the business
006128 part of the city, ostensibly as a match-seller but really as a
006129 beggar. For seven hours I plied my trade, and when I returned
006130 home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no
006131 less than 26s. 4d.
006132 
006133 "I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until,
006134 some time later, I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ
006135 served upon me for 25 pounds. I was at my wit's end where to get
006136 the money, but a sudden idea came to me. I begged a fortnight's
006137 grace from the creditor, asked for a holiday from my employers,
006138 and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise. In
006139 ten days I had the money and had paid the debt.
006140 
006141 "Well, you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous
006142 work at 2 pounds a week when I knew that I could earn as much in
006143 a day by smearing my face with a little paint, laying my cap on
006144 the ground, and sitting still. It was a long fight between my
006145 pride and the money, but the dollars won at last, and I threw up
006146 reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first
006147 chosen, inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my pockets
006148 with coppers. Only one man knew my secret. He was the keeper of a
006149 low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane, where I could
006150 every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings
006151 transform myself into a well-dressed man about town. This fellow,
006152 a Lascar, was well paid by me for his rooms, so that I knew that
006153 my secret was safe in his possession.
006154 
006155 "Well, very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of
006156 money. I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London
006157 could earn 700 pounds a year--which is less than my average
006158 takings--but I had exceptional advantages in my power of making
006159 up, and also in a facility of repartee, which improved by
006160 practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City.
006161 All day a stream of pennies, varied by silver, poured in upon me,
006162 and it was a very bad day in which I failed to take 2 pounds.
006163 
006164 "As I grew richer I grew more ambitious, took a house in the
006165 country, and eventually married, without anyone having a
006166 suspicion as to my real occupation. My dear wife knew that I had
006167 business in the City. She little knew what.
006168 
006169 "Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my
006170 room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw,
006171 to my horror and astonishment, that my wife was standing in the
006172 street, with her eyes fixed full upon me. I gave a cry of
006173 surprise, threw up my arms to cover my face, and, rushing to my
006174 confidant, the Lascar, entreated him to prevent anyone from
006175 coming up to me. I heard her voice downstairs, but I knew that
006176 she could not ascend. Swiftly I threw off my clothes, pulled on
006177 those of a beggar, and put on my pigments and wig. Even a wife's
006178 eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise. But then it
006179 occurred to me that there might be a search in the room, and that
006180 the clothes might betray me. I threw open the window, reopening
006181 by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in
006182 the bedroom that morning. Then I seized my coat, which was
006183 weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from
006184 the leather bag in which I carried my takings. I hurled it out of
006185 the window, and it disappeared into the Thames. The other clothes
006186 would have followed, but at that moment there was a rush of
006187 constables up the stair, and a few minutes after I found, rather,
006188 I confess, to my relief, that instead of being identified as Mr.
006189 Neville St. Clair, I was arrested as his murderer.
006190 
006191 "I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain. I
006192 was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible, and
006193 hence my preference for a dirty face. Knowing that my wife would
006194 be terribly anxious, I slipped off my ring and confided it to the
006195 Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me, together
006196 with a hurried scrawl, telling her that she had no cause to
006197 fear."
006198 
006199 "That note only reached her yesterday," said Holmes.
006200 
006201 "Good God! What a week she must have spent!"
006202 
006203 "The police have watched this Lascar," said Inspector Bradstreet,
006204 "and I can quite understand that he might find it difficult to
006205 post a letter unobserved. Probably he handed it to some sailor
006206 customer of his, who forgot all about it for some days."
006207 
006208 "That was it," said Holmes, nodding approvingly; "I have no doubt
006209 of it. But have you never been prosecuted for begging?"
006210 
006211 "Many times; but what was a fine to me?"
006212 
006213 "It must stop here, however," said Bradstreet. "If the police are
006214 to hush this thing up, there must be no more of Hugh Boone."
006215 
006216 "I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take."
006217 
006218 "In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps
006219 may be taken. But if you are found again, then all must come out.
006220 I am sure, Mr. Holmes, that we are very much indebted to you for
006221 having cleared the matter up. I wish I knew how you reach your
006222 results."
006223 
006224 "I reached this one," said my friend, "by sitting upon five
006225 pillows and consuming an ounce of shag. I think, Watson, that if
006226 we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast."
006227 
006228 
006229 
006230 VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
006231 
006232 I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second
006233 morning after Christmas, with the intention of wishing him the
006234 compliments of the season. He was lounging upon the sofa in a
006235 purple dressing-gown, a pipe-rack within his reach upon the
006236 right, and a pile of crumpled morning papers, evidently newly
006237 studied, near at hand. Beside the couch was a wooden chair, and
006238 on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable
006239 hard-felt hat, much the worse for wear, and cracked in several
006240 places. A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair
006241 suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the
006242 purpose of examination.
006243 
006244 "You are engaged," said I; "perhaps I interrupt you."
006245 
006246 "Not at all. I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss
006247 my results. The matter is a perfectly trivial one"--he jerked his
006248 thumb in the direction of the old hat--"but there are points in
006249 connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and
006250 even of instruction."
006251 
006252 I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his
006253 crackling fire, for a sharp frost had set in, and the windows
006254 were thick with the ice crystals. "I suppose," I remarked, "that,
006255 homely as it looks, this thing has some deadly story linked on to
006256 it--that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of
006257 some mystery and the punishment of some crime."
006258 
006259 "No, no. No crime," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "Only one of
006260 those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have
006261 four million human beings all jostling each other within the
006262 space of a few square miles. Amid the action and reaction of so
006263 dense a swarm of humanity, every possible combination of events
006264 may be expected to take place, and many a little problem will be
006265 presented which may be striking and bizarre without being
006266 criminal. We have already had experience of such."
006267 
006268 "So much so," I remarked, "that of the last six cases which I
006269 have added to my notes, three have been entirely free of any
006270 legal crime."
006271 
006272 "Precisely. You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler
006273 papers, to the singular case of Miss Mary Sutherland, and to the
006274 adventure of the man with the twisted lip. Well, I have no doubt
006275 that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category.
006276 You know Peterson, the commissionaire?"
006277 
006278 "Yes."
006279 
006280 "It is to him that this trophy belongs."
006281 
006282 "It is his hat."
006283 
006284 "No, no, he found it. Its owner is unknown. I beg that you will
006285 look upon it not as a battered billycock but as an intellectual
006286 problem. And, first, as to how it came here. It arrived upon
006287 Christmas morning, in company with a good fat goose, which is, I
006288 have no doubt, roasting at this moment in front of Peterson's
006289 fire. The facts are these: about four o'clock on Christmas
006290 morning, Peterson, who, as you know, is a very honest fellow, was
006291 returning from some small jollification and was making his way
006292 homeward down Tottenham Court Road. In front of him he saw, in
006293 the gaslight, a tallish man, walking with a slight stagger, and
006294 carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder. As he reached the
006295 corner of Goodge Street, a row broke out between this stranger
006296 and a little knot of roughs. One of the latter knocked off the
006297 man's hat, on which he raised his stick to defend himself and,
006298 swinging it over his head, smashed the shop window behind him.
006299 Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from his
006300 assailants; but the man, shocked at having broken the window, and
006301 seeing an official-looking person in uniform rushing towards him,
006302 dropped his goose, took to his heels, and vanished amid the
006303 labyrinth of small streets which lie at the back of Tottenham
006304 Court Road. The roughs had also fled at the appearance of
006305 Peterson, so that he was left in possession of the field of
006306 battle, and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this
006307 battered hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose."
006308 
006309 "Which surely he restored to their owner?"
006310 
006311 "My dear fellow, there lies the problem. It is true that 'For
006312 Mrs. Henry Baker' was printed upon a small card which was tied to
006313 the bird's left leg, and it is also true that the initials 'H.
006314 B.' are legible upon the lining of this hat, but as there are
006315 some thousands of Bakers, and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in
006316 this city of ours, it is not easy to restore lost property to any
006317 one of them."
006318 
006319 "What, then, did Peterson do?"
006320 
006321 "He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning,
006322 knowing that even the smallest problems are of interest to me.
006323 The goose we retained until this morning, when there were signs
006324 that, in spite of the slight frost, it would be well that it
006325 should be eaten without unnecessary delay. Its finder has carried
006326 it off, therefore, to fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose,
006327 while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who
006328 lost his Christmas dinner."
006329 
006330 "Did he not advertise?"
006331 
006332 "No."
006333 
006334 "Then, what clue could you have as to his identity?"
006335 
006336 "Only as much as we can deduce."
006337 
006338 "From his hat?"
006339 
006340 "Precisely."
006341 
006342 "But you are joking. What can you gather from this old battered
006343 felt?"
006344 
006345 "Here is my lens. You know my methods. What can you gather
006346 yourself as to the individuality of the man who has worn this
006347 article?"
006348 
006349 I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather
006350 ruefully. It was a very ordinary black hat of the usual round
006351 shape, hard and much the worse for wear. The lining had been of
006352 red silk, but was a good deal discoloured. There was no maker's
006353 name; but, as Holmes had remarked, the initials "H. B." were
006354 scrawled upon one side. It was pierced in the brim for a
006355 hat-securer, but the elastic was missing. For the rest, it was
006356 cracked, exceedingly dusty, and spotted in several places,
006357 although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
006358 discoloured patches by smearing them with ink.
006359 
006360 "I can see nothing," said I, handing it back to my friend.
006361 
006362 "On the contrary, Watson, you can see everything. You fail,
006363 however, to reason from what you see. You are too timid in
006364 drawing your inferences."
006365 
006366 "Then, pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat?"
006367 
006368 He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective
006369 fashion which was characteristic of him. "It is perhaps less
006370 suggestive than it might have been," he remarked, "and yet there
006371 are a few inferences which are very distinct, and a few others
006372 which represent at least a strong balance of probability. That
006373 the man was highly intellectual is of course obvious upon the
006374 face of it, and also that he was fairly well-to-do within the
006375 last three years, although he has now fallen upon evil days. He
006376 had foresight, but has less now than formerly, pointing to a
006377 moral retrogression, which, when taken with the decline of his
006378 fortunes, seems to indicate some evil influence, probably drink,
006379 at work upon him. This may account also for the obvious fact that
006380 his wife has ceased to love him."
006381 
006382 "My dear Holmes!"
006383 
006384 "He has, however, retained some degree of self-respect," he
006385 continued, disregarding my remonstrance. "He is a man who leads a
006386 sedentary life, goes out little, is out of training entirely, is
006387 middle-aged, has grizzled hair which he has had cut within the
006388 last few days, and which he anoints with lime-cream. These are
006389 the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat. Also,
006390 by the way, that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid
006391 on in his house."
006392 
006393 "You are certainly joking, Holmes."
006394 
006395 "Not in the least. Is it possible that even now, when I give you
006396 these results, you are unable to see how they are attained?"
006397 
006398 "I have no doubt that I am very stupid, but I must confess that I
006399 am unable to follow you. For example, how did you deduce that
006400 this man was intellectual?"
006401 
006402 For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head. It came right
006403 over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose. "It is
006404 a question of cubic capacity," said he; "a man with so large a
006405 brain must have something in it."
006406 
006407 "The decline of his fortunes, then?"
006408 
006409 "This hat is three years old. These flat brims curled at the edge
006410 came in then. It is a hat of the very best quality. Look at the
006411 band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining. If this man could
006412 afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago, and has had no
006413 hat since, then he has assuredly gone down in the world."
006414 
006415 "Well, that is clear enough, certainly. But how about the
006416 foresight and the moral retrogression?"
006417 
006418 Sherlock Holmes laughed. "Here is the foresight," said he putting
006419 his finger upon the little disc and loop of the hat-securer.
006420 "They are never sold upon hats. If this man ordered one, it is a
006421 sign of a certain amount of foresight, since he went out of his
006422 way to take this precaution against the wind. But since we see
006423 that he has broken the elastic and has not troubled to replace
006424 it, it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly,
006425 which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature. On the other
006426 hand, he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains upon the
006427 felt by daubing them with ink, which is a sign that he has not
006428 entirely lost his self-respect."
006429 
006430 "Your reasoning is certainly plausible."
006431 
006432 "The further points, that he is middle-aged, that his hair is
006433 grizzled, that it has been recently cut, and that he uses
006434 lime-cream, are all to be gathered from a close examination of the
006435 lower part of the lining. The lens discloses a large number of
006436 hair-ends, clean cut by the scissors of the barber. They all
006437 appear to be adhesive, and there is a distinct odour of
006438 lime-cream. This dust, you will observe, is not the gritty, grey
006439 dust of the street but the fluffy brown dust of the house,
006440 showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time, while
006441 the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the
006442 wearer perspired very freely, and could therefore, hardly be in
006443 the best of training."
006444 
006445 "But his wife--you said that she had ceased to love him."
006446 
006447 "This hat has not been brushed for weeks. When I see you, my dear
006448 Watson, with a week's accumulation of dust upon your hat, and
006449 when your wife allows you to go out in such a state, I shall fear
006450 that you also have been unfortunate enough to lose your wife's
006451 affection."
006452 
006453 "But he might be a bachelor."
006454 
006455 "Nay, he was bringing home the goose as a peace-offering to his
006456 wife. Remember the card upon the bird's leg."
006457 
006458 "You have an answer to everything. But how on earth do you deduce
006459 that the gas is not laid on in his house?"
006460 
006461 "One tallow stain, or even two, might come by chance; but when I
006462 see no less than five, I think that there can be little doubt
006463 that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with
006464 burning tallow--walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in
006465 one hand and a guttering candle in the other. Anyhow, he never
006466 got tallow-stains from a gas-jet. Are you satisfied?"
006467 
006468 "Well, it is very ingenious," said I, laughing; "but since, as
006469 you said just now, there has been no crime committed, and no harm
006470 done save the loss of a goose, all this seems to be rather a
006471 waste of energy."
006472 
006473 Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply, when the door flew
006474 open, and Peterson, the commissionaire, rushed into the apartment
006475 with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with
006476 astonishment.
006477 
006478 "The goose, Mr. Holmes! The goose, sir!" he gasped.
006479 
006480 "Eh? What of it, then? Has it returned to life and flapped off
006481 through the kitchen window?" Holmes twisted himself round upon
006482 the sofa to get a fairer view of the man's excited face.
006483 
006484 "See here, sir! See what my wife found in its crop!" He held out
006485 his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly
006486 scintillating blue stone, rather smaller than a bean in size, but
006487 of such purity and radiance that it twinkled like an electric
006488 point in the dark hollow of his hand.
006489 
006490 Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle. "By Jove, Peterson!" said
006491 he, "this is treasure trove indeed. I suppose you know what you
006492 have got?"
006493 
006494 "A diamond, sir? A precious stone. It cuts into glass as though
006495 it were putty."
006496 
006497 "It's more than a precious stone. It is the precious stone."
006498 
006499 "Not the Countess of Morcar's blue carbuncle!" I ejaculated.
006500 
006501 "Precisely so. I ought to know its size and shape, seeing that I
006502 have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day
006503 lately. It is absolutely unique, and its value can only be
006504 conjectured, but the reward offered of 1000 pounds is certainly
006505 not within a twentieth part of the market price."
006506 
006507 "A thousand pounds! Great Lord of mercy!" The commissionaire
006508 plumped down into a chair and stared from one to the other of us.
006509 
006510 "That is the reward, and I have reason to know that there are
006511 sentimental considerations in the background which would induce
006512 the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but
006513 recover the gem."
006514 
006515 "It was lost, if I remember aright, at the Hotel Cosmopolitan," I
006516 remarked.
006517 
006518 "Precisely so, on December 22nd, just five days ago. John Horner,
006519 a plumber, was accused of having abstracted it from the lady's
006520 jewel-case. The evidence against him was so strong that the case
006521 has been referred to the Assizes. I have some account of the
006522 matter here, I believe." He rummaged amid his newspapers,
006523 glancing over the dates, until at last he smoothed one out,
006524 doubled it over, and read the following paragraph:
006525 
006526 "Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery. John Horner, 26, plumber, was
006527 brought up upon the charge of having upon the 22nd inst.,
006528 abstracted from the jewel-case of the Countess of Morcar the
006529 valuable gem known as the blue carbuncle. James Ryder,
006530 upper-attendant at the hotel, gave his evidence to the effect
006531 that he had shown Horner up to the dressing-room of the Countess
006532 of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might
006533 solder the second bar of the grate, which was loose. He had
006534 remained with Horner some little time, but had finally been
006535 called away. On returning, he found that Horner had disappeared,
006536 that the bureau had been forced open, and that the small morocco
006537 casket in which, as it afterwards transpired, the Countess was
006538 accustomed to keep her jewel, was lying empty upon the
006539 dressing-table. Ryder instantly gave the alarm, and Horner was
006540 arrested the same evening; but the stone could not be found
006541 either upon his person or in his rooms. Catherine Cusack, maid to
006542 the Countess, deposed to having heard Ryder's cry of dismay on
006543 discovering the robbery, and to having rushed into the room,
006544 where she found matters as described by the last witness.
006545 Inspector Bradstreet, B division, gave evidence as to the arrest
006546 of Horner, who struggled frantically, and protested his innocence
006547 in the strongest terms. Evidence of a previous conviction for
006548 robbery having been given against the prisoner, the magistrate
006549 refused to deal summarily with the offence, but referred it to
006550 the Assizes. Horner, who had shown signs of intense emotion
006551 during the proceedings, fainted away at the conclusion and was
006552 carried out of court."
006553 
006554 "Hum! So much for the police-court," said Holmes thoughtfully,
006555 tossing aside the paper. "The question for us now to solve is the
006556 sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel-case at one end to
006557 the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other. You
006558 see, Watson, our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much
006559 more important and less innocent aspect. Here is the stone; the
006560 stone came from the goose, and the goose came from Mr. Henry
006561 Baker, the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other
006562 characteristics with which I have bored you. So now we must set
006563 ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and
006564 ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery. To
006565 do this, we must try the simplest means first, and these lie
006566 undoubtedly in an advertisement in all the evening papers. If
006567 this fail, I shall have recourse to other methods."
006568 
006569 "What will you say?"
006570 
006571 "Give me a pencil and that slip of paper. Now, then: 'Found at
006572 the corner of Goodge Street, a goose and a black felt hat. Mr.
006573 Henry Baker can have the same by applying at 6:30 this evening at
006574 221B, Baker Street.' That is clear and concise."
006575 
006576 "Very. But will he see it?"
006577 
006578 "Well, he is sure to keep an eye on the papers, since, to a poor
006579 man, the loss was a heavy one. He was clearly so scared by his
006580 mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson
006581 that he thought of nothing but flight, but since then he must
006582 have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his
006583 bird. Then, again, the introduction of his name will cause him to
006584 see it, for everyone who knows him will direct his attention to
006585 it. Here you are, Peterson, run down to the advertising agency
006586 and have this put in the evening papers."
006587 
006588 "In which, sir?"
006589 
006590 "Oh, in the Globe, Star, Pall Mall, St. James's, Evening News,
006591 Standard, Echo, and any others that occur to you."
006592 
006593 "Very well, sir. And this stone?"
006594 
006595 "Ah, yes, I shall keep the stone. Thank you. And, I say,
006596 Peterson, just buy a goose on your way back and leave it here
006597 with me, for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place
006598 of the one which your family is now devouring."
006599 
006600 When the commissionaire had gone, Holmes took up the stone and
006601 held it against the light. "It's a bonny thing," said he. "Just
006602 see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and
006603 focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet
006604 baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a
006605 bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found
006606 in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable
006607 in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is
006608 blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has
006609 already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a
006610 vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about
006611 for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal.
006612 Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the
006613 gallows and the prison? I'll lock it up in my strong box now and
006614 drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it."
006615 
006616 "Do you think that this man Horner is innocent?"
006617 
006618 "I cannot tell."
006619 
006620 "Well, then, do you imagine that this other one, Henry Baker, had
006621 anything to do with the matter?"
006622 
006623 "It is, I think, much more likely that Henry Baker is an
006624 absolutely innocent man, who had no idea that the bird which he
006625 was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made
006626 of solid gold. That, however, I shall determine by a very simple
006627 test if we have an answer to our advertisement."
006628 
006629 "And you can do nothing until then?"
006630 
006631 "Nothing."
006632 
006633 "In that case I shall continue my professional round. But I shall
006634 come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned, for I
006635 should like to see the solution of so tangled a business."
006636 
006637 "Very glad to see you. I dine at seven. There is a woodcock, I
006638 believe. By the way, in view of recent occurrences, perhaps I
006639 ought to ask Mrs. Hudson to examine its crop."
006640 
006641 I had been delayed at a case, and it was a little after half-past
006642 six when I found myself in Baker Street once more. As I
006643 approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a
006644 coat which was buttoned up to his chin waiting outside in the
006645 bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight. Just as I
006646 arrived the door was opened, and we were shown up together to
006647 Holmes' room.
006648 
006649 "Mr. Henry Baker, I believe," said he, rising from his armchair
006650 and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he
006651 could so readily assume. "Pray take this chair by the fire, Mr.
006652 Baker. It is a cold night, and I observe that your circulation is
006653 more adapted for summer than for winter. Ah, Watson, you have
006654 just come at the right time. Is that your hat, Mr. Baker?"
006655 
006656 "Yes, sir, that is undoubtedly my hat."
006657 
006658 He was a large man with rounded shoulders, a massive head, and a
006659 broad, intelligent face, sloping down to a pointed beard of
006660 grizzled brown. A touch of red in nose and cheeks, with a slight
006661 tremor of his extended hand, recalled Holmes' surmise as to his
006662 habits. His rusty black frock-coat was buttoned right up in
006663 front, with the collar turned up, and his lank wrists protruded
006664 from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt. He spoke in a
006665 slow staccato fashion, choosing his words with care, and gave the
006666 impression generally of a man of learning and letters who had had
006667 ill-usage at the hands of fortune.
006668 
006669 "We have retained these things for some days," said Holmes,
006670 "because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your
006671 address. I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise."
006672 
006673 Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh. "Shillings have not
006674 been so plentiful with me as they once were," he remarked. "I had
006675 no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off
006676 both my hat and the bird. I did not care to spend more money in a
006677 hopeless attempt at recovering them."
006678 
006679 "Very naturally. By the way, about the bird, we were compelled to
006680 eat it."
006681 
006682 "To eat it!" Our visitor half rose from his chair in his
006683 excitement.
006684 
006685 "Yes, it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so.
006686 But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard, which is
006687 about the same weight and perfectly fresh, will answer your
006688 purpose equally well?"
006689 
006690 "Oh, certainly, certainly," answered Mr. Baker with a sigh of
006691 relief.
006692 
006693 "Of course, we still have the feathers, legs, crop, and so on of
006694 your own bird, so if you wish--"
006695 
006696 The man burst into a hearty laugh. "They might be useful to me as
006697 relics of my adventure," said he, "but beyond that I can hardly
006698 see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are
006699 going to be to me. No, sir, I think that, with your permission, I
006700 will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive
006701 upon the sideboard."
006702 
006703 Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug
006704 of his shoulders.
006705 
006706 "There is your hat, then, and there your bird," said he. "By the
006707 way, would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one
006708 from? I am somewhat of a fowl fancier, and I have seldom seen a
006709 better grown goose."
006710 
006711 "Certainly, sir," said Baker, who had risen and tucked his newly
006712 gained property under his arm. "There are a few of us who
006713 frequent the Alpha Inn, near the Museum--we are to be found in
006714 the Museum itself during the day, you understand. This year our
006715 good host, Windigate by name, instituted a goose club, by which,
006716 on consideration of some few pence every week, we were each to
006717 receive a bird at Christmas. My pence were duly paid, and the
006718 rest is familiar to you. I am much indebted to you, sir, for a
006719 Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity." With
006720 a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and
006721 strode off upon his way.
006722 
006723 "So much for Mr. Henry Baker," said Holmes when he had closed the
006724 door behind him. "It is quite certain that he knows nothing
006725 whatever about the matter. Are you hungry, Watson?"
006726 
006727 "Not particularly."
006728 
006729 "Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow
006730 up this clue while it is still hot."
006731 
006732 "By all means."
006733 
006734 It was a bitter night, so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped
006735 cravats about our throats. Outside, the stars were shining coldly
006736 in a cloudless sky, and the breath of the passers-by blew out
006737 into smoke like so many pistol shots. Our footfalls rang out
006738 crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors' quarter,
006739 Wimpole Street, Harley Street, and so through Wigmore Street into
006740 Oxford Street. In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at
006741 the Alpha Inn, which is a small public-house at the corner of one
006742 of the streets which runs down into Holborn. Holmes pushed open
006743 the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from
006744 the ruddy-faced, white-aproned landlord.
006745 
006746 "Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese,"
006747 said he.
006748 
006749 "My geese!" The man seemed surprised.
006750 
006751 "Yes. I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr. Henry Baker,
006752 who was a member of your goose club."
006753 
006754 "Ah! yes, I see. But you see, sir, them's not our geese."
006755 
006756 "Indeed! Whose, then?"
006757 
006758 "Well, I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden."
006759 
006760 "Indeed? I know some of them. Which was it?"
006761 
006762 "Breckinridge is his name."
006763 
006764 "Ah! I don't know him. Well, here's your good health landlord,
006765 and prosperity to your house. Good-night."
006766 
006767 "Now for Mr. Breckinridge," he continued, buttoning up his coat
006768 as we came out into the frosty air. "Remember, Watson that though
006769 we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain, we
006770 have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years' penal
006771 servitude unless we can establish his innocence. It is possible
006772 that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt; but, in any case, we
006773 have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police,
006774 and which a singular chance has placed in our hands. Let us
006775 follow it out to the bitter end. Faces to the south, then, and
006776 quick march!"
006777 
006778 We passed across Holborn, down Endell Street, and so through a
006779 zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market. One of the largest
006780 stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it, and the proprietor
006781 a horsey-looking man, with a sharp face and trim side-whiskers was
006782 helping a boy to put up the shutters.
006783 
006784 "Good-evening. It's a cold night," said Holmes.
006785 
006786 The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my
006787 companion.
006788 
006789 "Sold out of geese, I see," continued Holmes, pointing at the
006790 bare slabs of marble.
006791 
006792 "Let you have five hundred to-morrow morning."
006793 
006794 "That's no good."
006795 
006796 "Well, there are some on the stall with the gas-flare."
006797 
006798 "Ah, but I was recommended to you."
006799 
006800 "Who by?"
006801 
006802 "The landlord of the Alpha."
006803 
006804 "Oh, yes; I sent him a couple of dozen."
006805 
006806 "Fine birds they were, too. Now where did you get them from?"
006807 
006808 To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the
006809 salesman.
006810 
006811 "Now, then, mister," said he, with his head cocked and his arms
006812 akimbo, "what are you driving at? Let's have it straight, now."
006813 
006814 "It is straight enough. I should like to know who sold you the
006815 geese which you supplied to the Alpha."
006816 
006817 "Well then, I shan't tell you. So now!"
006818 
006819 "Oh, it is a matter of no importance; but I don't know why you
006820 should be so warm over such a trifle."
006821 
006822 "Warm! You'd be as warm, maybe, if you were as pestered as I am.
006823 When I pay good money for a good article there should be an end
006824 of the business; but it's 'Where are the geese?' and 'Who did you
006825 sell the geese to?' and 'What will you take for the geese?' One
006826 would think they were the only geese in the world, to hear the
006827 fuss that is made over them."
006828 
006829 "Well, I have no connection with any other people who have been
006830 making inquiries," said Holmes carelessly. "If you won't tell us
006831 the bet is off, that is all. But I'm always ready to back my
006832 opinion on a matter of fowls, and I have a fiver on it that the
006833 bird I ate is country bred."
006834 
006835 "Well, then, you've lost your fiver, for it's town bred," snapped
006836 the salesman.
006837 
006838 "It's nothing of the kind."
006839 
006840 "I say it is."
006841 
006842 "I don't believe it."
006843 
006844 "D'you think you know more about fowls than I, who have handled
006845 them ever since I was a nipper? I tell you, all those birds that
006846 went to the Alpha were town bred."
006847 
006848 "You'll never persuade me to believe that."
006849 
006850 "Will you bet, then?"
006851 
006852 "It's merely taking your money, for I know that I am right. But
006853 I'll have a sovereign on with you, just to teach you not to be
006854 obstinate."
006855 
006856 The salesman chuckled grimly. "Bring me the books, Bill," said
006857 he.
006858 
006859 The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great
006860 greasy-backed one, laying them out together beneath the hanging
006861 lamp.
006862 
006863 "Now then, Mr. Cocksure," said the salesman, "I thought that I
006864 was out of geese, but before I finish you'll find that there is
006865 still one left in my shop. You see this little book?"
006866 
006867 "Well?"
006868 
006869 "That's the list of the folk from whom I buy. D'you see? Well,
006870 then, here on this page are the country folk, and the numbers
006871 after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger.
006872 Now, then! You see this other page in red ink? Well, that is a
006873 list of my town suppliers. Now, look at that third name. Just
006874 read it out to me."
006875 
006876 "Mrs. Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road--249," read Holmes.
006877 
006878 "Quite so. Now turn that up in the ledger."
006879 
006880 Holmes turned to the page indicated. "Here you are, 'Mrs.
006881 Oakshott, 117, Brixton Road, egg and poultry supplier.'"
006882 
006883 "Now, then, what's the last entry?"
006884 
006885 "'December 22nd. Twenty-four geese at 7s. 6d.'"
006886 
006887 "Quite so. There you are. And underneath?"
006888 
006889 "'Sold to Mr. Windigate of the Alpha, at 12s.'"
006890 
006891 "What have you to say now?"
006892 
006893 Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined. He drew a sovereign from
006894 his pocket and threw it down upon the slab, turning away with the
006895 air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words. A few yards off
006896 he stopped under a lamp-post and laughed in the hearty, noiseless
006897 fashion which was peculiar to him.
006898 
006899 "When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the 'Pink 'un'
006900 protruding out of his pocket, you can always draw him by a bet,"
006901 said he. "I daresay that if I had put 100 pounds down in front of
006902 him, that man would not have given me such complete information
006903 as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a
006904 wager. Well, Watson, we are, I fancy, nearing the end of our
006905 quest, and the only point which remains to be determined is
006906 whether we should go on to this Mrs. Oakshott to-night, or
006907 whether we should reserve it for to-morrow. It is clear from what
006908 that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves
006909 who are anxious about the matter, and I should--"
006910 
006911 His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke
006912 out from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a
006913 little rat-faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of
006914 yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp, while
006915 Breckinridge, the salesman, framed in the door of his stall, was
006916 shaking his fists fiercely at the cringing figure.
006917 
006918 "I've had enough of you and your geese," he shouted. "I wish you
006919 were all at the devil together. If you come pestering me any more
006920 with your silly talk I'll set the dog at you. You bring Mrs.
006921 Oakshott here and I'll answer her, but what have you to do with
006922 it? Did I buy the geese off you?"
006923 
006924 "No; but one of them was mine all the same," whined the little
006925 man.
006926 
006927 "Well, then, ask Mrs. Oakshott for it."
006928 
006929 "She told me to ask you."
006930 
006931 "Well, you can ask the King of Proosia, for all I care. I've had
006932 enough of it. Get out of this!" He rushed fiercely forward, and
006933 the inquirer flitted away into the darkness.
006934 
006935 "Ha! this may save us a visit to Brixton Road," whispered Holmes.
006936 "Come with me, and we will see what is to be made of this
006937 fellow." Striding through the scattered knots of people who
006938 lounged round the flaring stalls, my companion speedily overtook
006939 the little man and touched him upon the shoulder. He sprang
006940 round, and I could see in the gas-light that every vestige of
006941 colour had been driven from his face.
006942 
006943 "Who are you, then? What do you want?" he asked in a quavering
006944 voice.
006945 
006946 "You will excuse me," said Holmes blandly, "but I could not help
006947 overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now.
006948 I think that I could be of assistance to you."
006949 
006950 "You? Who are you? How could you know anything of the matter?"
006951 
006952 "My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other
006953 people don't know."
006954 
006955 "But you can know nothing of this?"
006956 
006957 "Excuse me, I know everything of it. You are endeavouring to
006958 trace some geese which were sold by Mrs. Oakshott, of Brixton
006959 Road, to a salesman named Breckinridge, by him in turn to Mr.
006960 Windigate, of the Alpha, and by him to his club, of which Mr.
006961 Henry Baker is a member."
006962 
006963 "Oh, sir, you are the very man whom I have longed to meet," cried
006964 the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers.
006965 "I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter."
006966 
006967 Sherlock Holmes hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. "In that
006968 case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this
006969 wind-swept market-place," said he. "But pray tell me, before we
006970 go farther, who it is that I have the pleasure of assisting."
006971 
006972 The man hesitated for an instant. "My name is John Robinson," he
006973 answered with a sidelong glance.
006974 
006975 "No, no; the real name," said Holmes sweetly. "It is always
006976 awkward doing business with an alias."
006977 
006978 A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger. "Well then,"
006979 said he, "my real name is James Ryder."
006980 
006981 "Precisely so. Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan. Pray
006982 step into the cab, and I shall soon be able to tell you
006983 everything which you would wish to know."
006984 
006985 The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with
006986 half-frightened, half-hopeful eyes, as one who is not sure
006987 whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe.
006988 Then he stepped into the cab, and in half an hour we were back in
006989 the sitting-room at Baker Street. Nothing had been said during
006990 our drive, but the high, thin breathing of our new companion, and
006991 the claspings and unclaspings of his hands, spoke of the nervous
006992 tension within him.
006993 
006994 "Here we are!" said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room.
006995 "The fire looks very seasonable in this weather. You look cold,
006996 Mr. Ryder. Pray take the basket-chair. I will just put on my
006997 slippers before we settle this little matter of yours. Now, then!
006998 You want to know what became of those geese?"
006999 
007000 "Yes, sir."
007001 
007002 "Or rather, I fancy, of that goose. It was one bird, I imagine in
007003 which you were interested--white, with a black bar across the
007004 tail."
007005 
007006 Ryder quivered with emotion. "Oh, sir," he cried, "can you tell
007007 me where it went to?"
007008 
007009 "It came here."
007010 
007011 "Here?"
007012 
007013 "Yes, and a most remarkable bird it proved. I don't wonder that
007014 you should take an interest in it. It laid an egg after it was
007015 dead--the bonniest, brightest little blue egg that ever was seen.
007016 I have it here in my museum."
007017 
007018 Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece
007019 with his right hand. Holmes unlocked his strong-box and held up
007020 the blue carbuncle, which shone out like a star, with a cold,
007021 brilliant, many-pointed radiance. Ryder stood glaring with a
007022 drawn face, uncertain whether to claim or to disown it.
007023 
007024 "The game's up, Ryder," said Holmes quietly. "Hold up, man, or
007025 you'll be into the fire! Give him an arm back into his chair,
007026 Watson. He's not got blood enough to go in for felony with
007027 impunity. Give him a dash of brandy. So! Now he looks a little
007028 more human. What a shrimp it is, to be sure!"
007029 
007030 For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen, but the brandy
007031 brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks, and he sat staring
007032 with frightened eyes at his accuser.
007033 
007034 "I have almost every link in my hands, and all the proofs which I
007035 could possibly need, so there is little which you need tell me.
007036 Still, that little may as well be cleared up to make the case
007037 complete. You had heard, Ryder, of this blue stone of the
007038 Countess of Morcar's?"
007039 
007040 "It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it," said he in a
007041 crackling voice.
007042 
007043 "I see--her ladyship's waiting-maid. Well, the temptation of
007044 sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you, as it has
007045 been for better men before you; but you were not very scrupulous
007046 in the means you used. It seems to me, Ryder, that there is the
007047 making of a very pretty villain in you. You knew that this man
007048 Horner, the plumber, had been concerned in some such matter
007049 before, and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon him.
007050 What did you do, then? You made some small job in my lady's
007051 room--you and your confederate Cusack--and you managed that he
007052 should be the man sent for. Then, when he had left, you rifled
007053 the jewel-case, raised the alarm, and had this unfortunate man
007054 arrested. You then--"
007055 
007056 Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my
007057 companion's knees. "For God's sake, have mercy!" he shrieked.
007058 "Think of my father! Of my mother! It would break their hearts. I
007059 never went wrong before! I never will again. I swear it. I'll
007060 swear it on a Bible. Oh, don't bring it into court! For Christ's
007061 sake, don't!"
007062 
007063 "Get back into your chair!" said Holmes sternly. "It is very well
007064 to cringe and crawl now, but you thought little enough of this
007065 poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing."
007066 
007067 "I will fly, Mr. Holmes. I will leave the country, sir. Then the
007068 charge against him will break down."
007069 
007070 "Hum! We will talk about that. And now let us hear a true account
007071 of the next act. How came the stone into the goose, and how came
007072 the goose into the open market? Tell us the truth, for there lies
007073 your only hope of safety."
007074 
007075 Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips. "I will tell you
007076 it just as it happened, sir," said he. "When Horner had been
007077 arrested, it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get
007078 away with the stone at once, for I did not know at what moment
007079 the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my
007080 room. There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe.
007081 I went out, as if on some commission, and I made for my sister's
007082 house. She had married a man named Oakshott, and lived in Brixton
007083 Road, where she fattened fowls for the market. All the way there
007084 every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective;
007085 and, for all that it was a cold night, the sweat was pouring down
007086 my face before I came to the Brixton Road. My sister asked me
007087 what was the matter, and why I was so pale; but I told her that I
007088 had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel. Then I went
007089 into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would
007090 be best to do.
007091 
007092 "I had a friend once called Maudsley, who went to the bad, and
007093 has just been serving his time in Pentonville. One day he had met
007094 me, and fell into talk about the ways of thieves, and how they
007095 could get rid of what they stole. I knew that he would be true to
007096 me, for I knew one or two things about him; so I made up my mind
007097 to go right on to Kilburn, where he lived, and take him into my
007098 confidence. He would show me how to turn the stone into money.
007099 But how to get to him in safety? I thought of the agonies I had
007100 gone through in coming from the hotel. I might at any moment be
007101 seized and searched, and there would be the stone in my waistcoat
007102 pocket. I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at
007103 the geese which were waddling about round my feet, and suddenly
007104 an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the
007105 best detective that ever lived.
007106 
007107 "My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the
007108 pick of her geese for a Christmas present, and I knew that she
007109 was always as good as her word. I would take my goose now, and in
007110 it I would carry my stone to Kilburn. There was a little shed in
007111 the yard, and behind this I drove one of the birds--a fine big
007112 one, white, with a barred tail. I caught it, and prying its bill
007113 open, I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger
007114 could reach. The bird gave a gulp, and I felt the stone pass
007115 along its gullet and down into its crop. But the creature flapped
007116 and struggled, and out came my sister to know what was the
007117 matter. As I turned to speak to her the brute broke loose and
007118 fluttered off among the others.
007119 
007120 "'Whatever were you doing with that bird, Jem?' says she.
007121 
007122 "'Well,' said I, 'you said you'd give me one for Christmas, and I
007123 was feeling which was the fattest.'
007124 
007125 "'Oh,' says she, 'we've set yours aside for you--Jem's bird, we
007126 call it. It's the big white one over yonder. There's twenty-six
007127 of them, which makes one for you, and one for us, and two dozen
007128 for the market.'
007129 
007130 "'Thank you, Maggie,' says I; 'but if it is all the same to you,
007131 I'd rather have that one I was handling just now.'
007132 
007133 "'The other is a good three pound heavier,' said she, 'and we
007134 fattened it expressly for you.'
007135 
007136 "'Never mind. I'll have the other, and I'll take it now,' said I.
007137 
007138 "'Oh, just as you like,' said she, a little huffed. 'Which is it
007139 you want, then?'
007140 
007141 "'That white one with the barred tail, right in the middle of the
007142 flock.'
007143 
007144 "'Oh, very well. Kill it and take it with you.'
007145 
007146 "Well, I did what she said, Mr. Holmes, and I carried the bird
007147 all the way to Kilburn. I told my pal what I had done, for he was
007148 a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to. He laughed
007149 until he choked, and we got a knife and opened the goose. My
007150 heart turned to water, for there was no sign of the stone, and I
007151 knew that some terrible mistake had occurred. I left the bird,
007152 rushed back to my sister's, and hurried into the back yard. There
007153 was not a bird to be seen there.
007154 
007155 "'Where are they all, Maggie?' I cried.
007156 
007157 "'Gone to the dealer's, Jem.'
007158 
007159 "'Which dealer's?'
007160 
007161 "'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'
007162 
007163 "'But was there another with a barred tail?' I asked, 'the same
007164 as the one I chose?'
007165 
007166 "'Yes, Jem; there were two barred-tailed ones, and I could never
007167 tell them apart.'
007168 
007169 "Well, then, of course I saw it all, and I ran off as hard as my
007170 feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge; but he had sold the
007171 lot at once, and not one word would he tell me as to where they
007172 had gone. You heard him yourselves to-night. Well, he has always
007173 answered me like that. My sister thinks that I am going mad.
007174 Sometimes I think that I am myself. And now--and now I am myself
007175 a branded thief, without ever having touched the wealth for which
007176 I sold my character. God help me! God help me!" He burst into
007177 convulsive sobbing, with his face buried in his hands.
007178 
007179 There was a long silence, broken only by his heavy breathing and
007180 by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes' finger-tips upon the
007181 edge of the table. Then my friend rose and threw open the door.
007182 
007183 "Get out!" said he.
007184 
007185 "What, sir! Oh, Heaven bless you!"
007186 
007187 "No more words. Get out!"
007188 
007189 And no more words were needed. There was a rush, a clatter upon
007190 the stairs, the bang of a door, and the crisp rattle of running
007191 footfalls from the street.
007192 
007193 "After all, Watson," said Holmes, reaching up his hand for his
007194 clay pipe, "I am not retained by the police to supply their
007195 deficiencies. If Horner were in danger it would be another thing;
007196 but this fellow will not appear against him, and the case must
007197 collapse. I suppose that I am commuting a felony, but it is just
007198 possible that I am saving a soul. This fellow will not go wrong
007199 again; he is too terribly frightened. Send him to gaol now, and
007200 you make him a gaol-bird for life. Besides, it is the season of
007201 forgiveness. Chance has put in our way a most singular and
007202 whimsical problem, and its solution is its own reward. If you
007203 will have the goodness to touch the bell, Doctor, we will begin
007204 another investigation, in which, also a bird will be the chief
007205 feature."
007206 
007207 
007208 
007209 VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
007210 
007211 On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I
007212 have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend
007213 Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number
007214 merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did
007215 rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of
007216 wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation
007217 which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.
007218 Of all these varied cases, however, I cannot recall any which
007219 presented more singular features than that which was associated
007220 with the well-known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran.
007221 The events in question occurred in the early days of my
007222 association with Holmes, when we were sharing rooms as bachelors
007223 in Baker Street. It is possible that I might have placed them
007224 upon record before, but a promise of secrecy was made at the
007225 time, from which I have only been freed during the last month by
007226 the untimely death of the lady to whom the pledge was given. It
007227 is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light, for I
007228 have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the
007229 death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even
007230 more terrible than the truth.
007231 
007232 It was early in April in the year '83 that I woke one morning to
007233 find Sherlock Holmes standing, fully dressed, by the side of my
007234 bed. He was a late riser, as a rule, and as the clock on the
007235 mantelpiece showed me that it was only a quarter-past seven, I
007236 blinked up at him in some surprise, and perhaps just a little
007237 resentment, for I was myself regular in my habits.
007238 
007239 "Very sorry to knock you up, Watson," said he, "but it's the
007240 common lot this morning. Mrs. Hudson has been knocked up, she
007241 retorted upon me, and I on you."
007242 
007243 "What is it, then--a fire?"
007244 
007245 "No; a client. It seems that a young lady has arrived in a
007246 considerable state of excitement, who insists upon seeing me. She
007247 is waiting now in the sitting-room. Now, when young ladies wander
007248 about the metropolis at this hour of the morning, and knock
007249 sleepy people up out of their beds, I presume that it is
007250 something very pressing which they have to communicate. Should it
007251 prove to be an interesting case, you would, I am sure, wish to
007252 follow it from the outset. I thought, at any rate, that I should
007253 call you and give you the chance."
007254 
007255 "My dear fellow, I would not miss it for anything."
007256 
007257 I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his
007258 professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid
007259 deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a
007260 logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were
007261 submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in
007262 a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A
007263 lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in
007264 the window, rose as we entered.
007265 
007266 "Good-morning, madam," said Holmes cheerily. "My name is Sherlock
007267 Holmes. This is my intimate friend and associate, Dr. Watson,
007268 before whom you can speak as freely as before myself. Ha! I am
007269 glad to see that Mrs. Hudson has had the good sense to light the
007270 fire. Pray draw up to it, and I shall order you a cup of hot
007271 coffee, for I observe that you are shivering."
007272 
007273 "It is not cold which makes me shiver," said the woman in a low
007274 voice, changing her seat as requested.
007275 
007276 "What, then?"
007277 
007278 "It is fear, Mr. Holmes. It is terror." She raised her veil as
007279 she spoke, and we could see that she was indeed in a pitiable
007280 state of agitation, her face all drawn and grey, with restless
007281 frightened eyes, like those of some hunted animal. Her features
007282 and figure were those of a woman of thirty, but her hair was shot
007283 with premature grey, and her expression was weary and haggard.
007284 Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick,
007285 all-comprehensive glances.
007286 
007287 "You must not fear," said he soothingly, bending forward and
007288 patting her forearm. "We shall soon set matters right, I have no
007289 doubt. You have come in by train this morning, I see."
007290 
007291 "You know me, then?"
007292 
007293 "No, but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm
007294 of your left glove. You must have started early, and yet you had
007295 a good drive in a dog-cart, along heavy roads, before you reached
007296 the station."
007297 
007298 The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my
007299 companion.
007300 
007301 "There is no mystery, my dear madam," said he, smiling. "The left
007302 arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven
007303 places. The marks are perfectly fresh. There is no vehicle save a
007304 dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only when you
007305 sit on the left-hand side of the driver."
007306 
007307 "Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said
007308 she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at
007309 twenty past, and came in by the first train to Waterloo. Sir, I
007310 can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues.
007311 I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me,
007312 and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you,
007313 Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Farintosh, whom you
007314 helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had
007315 your address. Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me,
007316 too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness
007317 which surrounds me? At present it is out of my power to reward
007318 you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be
007319 married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you
007320 shall not find me ungrateful."
007321 
007322 Holmes turned to his desk and, unlocking it, drew out a small
007323 case-book, which he consulted.
007324 
007325 "Farintosh," said he. "Ah yes, I recall the case; it was
007326 concerned with an opal tiara. I think it was before your time,
007327 Watson. I can only say, madam, that I shall be happy to devote
007328 the same care to your case as I did to that of your friend. As to
007329 reward, my profession is its own reward; but you are at liberty
007330 to defray whatever expenses I may be put to, at the time which
007331 suits you best. And now I beg that you will lay before us
007332 everything that may help us in forming an opinion upon the
007333 matter."
007334 
007335 "Alas!" replied our visitor, "the very horror of my situation
007336 lies in the fact that my fears are so vague, and my suspicions
007337 depend so entirely upon small points, which might seem trivial to
007338 another, that even he to whom of all others I have a right to
007339 look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it
007340 as the fancies of a nervous woman. He does not say so, but I can
007341 read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes. But I have
007342 heard, Mr. Holmes, that you can see deeply into the manifold
007343 wickedness of the human heart. You may advise me how to walk amid
007344 the dangers which encompass me."
007345 
007346 "I am all attention, madam."
007347 
007348 "My name is Helen Stoner, and I am living with my stepfather, who
007349 is the last survivor of one of the oldest Saxon families in
007350 England, the Roylotts of Stoke Moran, on the western border of
007351 Surrey."
007352 
007353 Holmes nodded his head. "The name is familiar to me," said he.
007354 
007355 "The family was at one time among the richest in England, and the
007356 estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north,
007357 and Hampshire in the west. In the last century, however, four
007358 successive heirs were of a dissolute and wasteful disposition,
007359 and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the
007360 days of the Regency. Nothing was left save a few acres of ground,
007361 and the two-hundred-year-old house, which is itself crushed under
007362 a heavy mortgage. The last squire dragged out his existence
007363 there, living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper; but
007364 his only son, my stepfather, seeing that he must adapt himself to
007365 the new conditions, obtained an advance from a relative, which
007366 enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta,
007367 where, by his professional skill and his force of character, he
007368 established a large practice. In a fit of anger, however, caused
007369 by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house, he
007370 beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital
007371 sentence. As it was, he suffered a long term of imprisonment and
007372 afterwards returned to England a morose and disappointed man.
007373 
007374 "When Dr. Roylott was in India he married my mother, Mrs. Stoner,
007375 the young widow of Major-General Stoner, of the Bengal Artillery.
007376 My sister Julia and I were twins, and we were only two years old
007377 at the time of my mother's re-marriage. She had a considerable
007378 sum of money--not less than 1000 pounds a year--and this she
007379 bequeathed to Dr. Roylott entirely while we resided with him,
007380 with a provision that a certain annual sum should be allowed to
007381 each of us in the event of our marriage. Shortly after our return
007382 to England my mother died--she was killed eight years ago in a
007383 railway accident near Crewe. Dr. Roylott then abandoned his
007384 attempts to establish himself in practice in London and took us
007385 to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran. The
007386 money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants, and
007387 there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness.
007388 
007389 "But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time.
007390 Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our
007391 neighbours, who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of
007392 Stoke Moran back in the old family seat, he shut himself up in
007393 his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious
007394 quarrels with whoever might cross his path. Violence of temper
007395 approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the
007396 family, and in my stepfather's case it had, I believe, been
007397 intensified by his long residence in the tropics. A series of
007398 disgraceful brawls took place, two of which ended in the
007399 police-court, until at last he became the terror of the village,
007400 and the folks would fly at his approach, for he is a man of
007401 immense strength, and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger.
007402 
007403 "Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a
007404 stream, and it was only by paying over all the money which I
007405 could gather together that I was able to avert another public
007406 exposure. He had no friends at all save the wandering gipsies,
007407 and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few
007408 acres of bramble-covered land which represent the family estate,
007409 and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents,
007410 wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end. He has a
007411 passion also for Indian animals, which are sent over to him by a
007412 correspondent, and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon,
007413 which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the
007414 villagers almost as much as their master.
007415 
007416 "You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I
007417 had no great pleasure in our lives. No servant would stay with
007418 us, and for a long time we did all the work of the house. She was
007419 but thirty at the time of her death, and yet her hair had already
007420 begun to whiten, even as mine has."
007421 
007422 "Your sister is dead, then?"
007423 
007424 "She died just two years ago, and it is of her death that I wish
007425 to speak to you. You can understand that, living the life which I
007426 have described, we were little likely to see anyone of our own
007427 age and position. We had, however, an aunt, my mother's maiden
007428 sister, Miss Honoria Westphail, who lives near Harrow, and we
007429 were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady's
007430 house. Julia went there at Christmas two years ago, and met there
007431 a half-pay major of marines, to whom she became engaged. My
007432 stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and
007433 offered no objection to the marriage; but within a fortnight of
007434 the day which had been fixed for the wedding, the terrible event
007435 occurred which has deprived me of my only companion."
007436 
007437 Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes
007438 closed and his head sunk in a cushion, but he half opened his
007439 lids now and glanced across at his visitor.
007440 
007441 "Pray be precise as to details," said he.
007442 
007443 "It is easy for me to be so, for every event of that dreadful
007444 time is seared into my memory. The manor-house is, as I have
007445 already said, very old, and only one wing is now inhabited. The
007446 bedrooms in this wing are on the ground floor, the sitting-rooms
007447 being in the central block of the buildings. Of these bedrooms
007448 the first is Dr. Roylott's, the second my sister's, and the third
007449 my own. There is no communication between them, but they all open
007450 out into the same corridor. Do I make myself plain?"
007451 
007452 "Perfectly so."
007453 
007454 "The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn. That
007455 fatal night Dr. Roylott had gone to his room early, though we
007456 knew that he had not retired to rest, for my sister was troubled
007457 by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom
007458 to smoke. She left her room, therefore, and came into mine, where
007459 she sat for some time, chatting about her approaching wedding. At
007460 eleven o'clock she rose to leave me, but she paused at the door
007461 and looked back.
007462 
007463 "'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle
007464 in the dead of the night?'
007465 
007466 "'Never,' said I.
007467 
007468 "'I suppose that you could not possibly whistle, yourself, in
007469 your sleep?'
007470 
007471 "'Certainly not. But why?'
007472 
007473 "'Because during the last few nights I have always, about three
007474 in the morning, heard a low, clear whistle. I am a light sleeper,
007475 and it has awakened me. I cannot tell where it came from--perhaps
007476 from the next room, perhaps from the lawn. I thought that I would
007477 just ask you whether you had heard it.'
007478 
007479 "'No, I have not. It must be those wretched gipsies in the
007480 plantation.'
007481 
007482 "'Very likely. And yet if it were on the lawn, I wonder that you
007483 did not hear it also.'
007484 
007485 "'Ah, but I sleep more heavily than you.'
007486 
007487 "'Well, it is of no great consequence, at any rate.' She smiled
007488 back at me, closed my door, and a few moments later I heard her
007489 key turn in the lock."
007490 
007491 "Indeed," said Holmes. "Was it your custom always to lock
007492 yourselves in at night?"
007493 
007494 "Always."
007495 
007496 "And why?"
007497 
007498 "I think that I mentioned to you that the doctor kept a cheetah
007499 and a baboon. We had no feeling of security unless our doors were
007500 locked."
007501 
007502 "Quite so. Pray proceed with your statement."
007503 
007504 "I could not sleep that night. A vague feeling of impending
007505 misfortune impressed me. My sister and I, you will recollect,
007506 were twins, and you know how subtle are the links which bind two
007507 souls which are so closely allied. It was a wild night. The wind
007508 was howling outside, and the rain was beating and splashing
007509 against the windows. Suddenly, amid all the hubbub of the gale,
007510 there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman. I knew
007511 that it was my sister's voice. I sprang from my bed, wrapped a
007512 shawl round me, and rushed into the corridor. As I opened my door
007513 I seemed to hear a low whistle, such as my sister described, and
007514 a few moments later a clanging sound, as if a mass of metal had
007515 fallen. As I ran down the passage, my sister's door was unlocked,
007516 and revolved slowly upon its hinges. I stared at it
007517 horror-stricken, not knowing what was about to issue from it. By
007518 the light of the corridor-lamp I saw my sister appear at the
007519 opening, her face blanched with terror, her hands groping for
007520 help, her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a
007521 drunkard. I ran to her and threw my arms round her, but at that
007522 moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground.
007523 She writhed as one who is in terrible pain, and her limbs were
007524 dreadfully convulsed. At first I thought that she had not
007525 recognised me, but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out
007526 in a voice which I shall never forget, 'Oh, my God! Helen! It was
007527 the band! The speckled band!' There was something else which she
007528 would fain have said, and she stabbed with her finger into the
007529 air in the direction of the doctor's room, but a fresh convulsion
007530 seized her and choked her words. I rushed out, calling loudly for
007531 my stepfather, and I met him hastening from his room in his
007532 dressing-gown. When he reached my sister's side she was
007533 unconscious, and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent
007534 for medical aid from the village, all efforts were in vain, for
007535 she slowly sank and died without having recovered her
007536 consciousness. Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister."
007537 
007538 "One moment," said Holmes, "are you sure about this whistle and
007539 metallic sound? Could you swear to it?"
007540 
007541 "That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry. It is
007542 my strong impression that I heard it, and yet, among the crash of
007543 the gale and the creaking of an old house, I may possibly have
007544 been deceived."
007545 
007546 "Was your sister dressed?"
007547 
007548 "No, she was in her night-dress. In her right hand was found the
007549 charred stump of a match, and in her left a match-box."
007550 
007551 "Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when
007552 the alarm took place. That is important. And what conclusions did
007553 the coroner come to?"
007554 
007555 "He investigated the case with great care, for Dr. Roylott's
007556 conduct had long been notorious in the county, but he was unable
007557 to find any satisfactory cause of death. My evidence showed that
007558 the door had been fastened upon the inner side, and the windows
007559 were blocked by old-fashioned shutters with broad iron bars,
007560 which were secured every night. The walls were carefully sounded,
007561 and were shown to be quite solid all round, and the flooring was
007562 also thoroughly examined, with the same result. The chimney is
007563 wide, but is barred up by four large staples. It is certain,
007564 therefore, that my sister was quite alone when she met her end.
007565 Besides, there were no marks of any violence upon her."
007566 
007567 "How about poison?"
007568 
007569 "The doctors examined her for it, but without success."
007570 
007571 "What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of, then?"
007572 
007573 "It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock,
007574 though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine."
007575 
007576 "Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time?"
007577 
007578 "Yes, there are nearly always some there."
007579 
007580 "Ah, and what did you gather from this allusion to a band--a
007581 speckled band?"
007582 
007583 "Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of
007584 delirium, sometimes that it may have referred to some band of
007585 people, perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation. I do not
007586 know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear
007587 over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which
007588 she used."
007589 
007590 Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied.
007591 
007592 "These are very deep waters," said he; "pray go on with your
007593 narrative."
007594 
007595 "Two years have passed since then, and my life has been until
007596 lately lonelier than ever. A month ago, however, a dear friend,
007597 whom I have known for many years, has done me the honour to ask
007598 my hand in marriage. His name is Armitage--Percy Armitage--the
007599 second son of Mr. Armitage, of Crane Water, near Reading. My
007600 stepfather has offered no opposition to the match, and we are to
007601 be married in the course of the spring. Two days ago some repairs
007602 were started in the west wing of the building, and my bedroom
007603 wall has been pierced, so that I have had to move into the
007604 chamber in which my sister died, and to sleep in the very bed in
007605 which she slept. Imagine, then, my thrill of terror when last
007606 night, as I lay awake, thinking over her terrible fate, I
007607 suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which
007608 had been the herald of her own death. I sprang up and lit the
007609 lamp, but nothing was to be seen in the room. I was too shaken to
007610 go to bed again, however, so I dressed, and as soon as it was
007611 daylight I slipped down, got a dog-cart at the Crown Inn, which
007612 is opposite, and drove to Leatherhead, from whence I have come on
007613 this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your
007614 advice."
007615 
007616 "You have done wisely," said my friend. "But have you told me
007617 all?"
007618 
007619 "Yes, all."
007620 
007621 "Miss Roylott, you have not. You are screening your stepfather."
007622 
007623 "Why, what do you mean?"
007624 
007625 For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which
007626 fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor's knee. Five little
007627 livid spots, the marks of four fingers and a thumb, were printed
007628 upon the white wrist.
007629 
007630 "You have been cruelly used," said Holmes.
007631 
007632 The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist. "He
007633 is a hard man," she said, "and perhaps he hardly knows his own
007634 strength."
007635 
007636 There was a long silence, during which Holmes leaned his chin
007637 upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire.
007638 
007639 "This is a very deep business," he said at last. "There are a
007640 thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide
007641 upon our course of action. Yet we have not a moment to lose. If
007642 we were to come to Stoke Moran to-day, would it be possible for
007643 us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your
007644 stepfather?"
007645 
007646 "As it happens, he spoke of coming into town to-day upon some
007647 most important business. It is probable that he will be away all
007648 day, and that there would be nothing to disturb you. We have a
007649 housekeeper now, but she is old and foolish, and I could easily
007650 get her out of the way."
007651 
007652 "Excellent. You are not averse to this trip, Watson?"
007653 
007654 "By no means."
007655 
007656 "Then we shall both come. What are you going to do yourself?"
007657 
007658 "I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am
007659 in town. But I shall return by the twelve o'clock train, so as to
007660 be there in time for your coming."
007661 
007662 "And you may expect us early in the afternoon. I have myself some
007663 small business matters to attend to. Will you not wait and
007664 breakfast?"
007665 
007666 "No, I must go. My heart is lightened already since I have
007667 confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward to seeing you
007668 again this afternoon." She dropped her thick black veil over her
007669 face and glided from the room.
007670 
007671 "And what do you think of it all, Watson?" asked Sherlock Holmes,
007672 leaning back in his chair.
007673 
007674 "It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business."
007675 
007676 "Dark enough and sinister enough."
007677 
007678 "Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls
007679 are sound, and that the door, window, and chimney are impassable,
007680 then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her
007681 mysterious end."
007682 
007683 "What becomes, then, of these nocturnal whistles, and what of the
007684 very peculiar words of the dying woman?"
007685 
007686 "I cannot think."
007687 
007688 "When you combine the ideas of whistles at night, the presence of
007689 a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor,
007690 the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has
007691 an interest in preventing his stepdaughter's marriage, the dying
007692 allusion to a band, and, finally, the fact that Miss Helen Stoner
007693 heard a metallic clang, which might have been caused by one of
007694 those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back into its
007695 place, I think that there is good ground to think that the
007696 mystery may be cleared along those lines."
007697 
007698 "But what, then, did the gipsies do?"
007699 
007700 "I cannot imagine."
007701 
007702 "I see many objections to any such theory."
007703 
007704 "And so do I. It is precisely for that reason that we are going
007705 to Stoke Moran this day. I want to see whether the objections are
007706 fatal, or if they may be explained away. But what in the name of
007707 the devil!"
007708 
007709 The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that
007710 our door had been suddenly dashed open, and that a huge man had
007711 framed himself in the aperture. His costume was a peculiar
007712 mixture of the professional and of the agricultural, having a
007713 black top-hat, a long frock-coat, and a pair of high gaiters,
007714 with a hunting-crop swinging in his hand. So tall was he that his
007715 hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway, and his
007716 breadth seemed to span it across from side to side. A large face,
007717 seared with a thousand wrinkles, burned yellow with the sun, and
007718 marked with every evil passion, was turned from one to the other
007719 of us, while his deep-set, bile-shot eyes, and his high, thin,
007720 fleshless nose, gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old
007721 bird of prey.
007722 
007723 "Which of you is Holmes?" asked this apparition.
007724 
007725 "My name, sir; but you have the advantage of me," said my
007726 companion quietly.
007727 
007728 "I am Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of Stoke Moran."
007729 
007730 "Indeed, Doctor," said Holmes blandly. "Pray take a seat."
007731 
007732 "I will do nothing of the kind. My stepdaughter has been here. I
007733 have traced her. What has she been saying to you?"
007734 
007735 "It is a little cold for the time of the year," said Holmes.
007736 
007737 "What has she been saying to you?" screamed the old man
007738 furiously.
007739 
007740 "But I have heard that the crocuses promise well," continued my
007741 companion imperturbably.
007742 
007743 "Ha! You put me off, do you?" said our new visitor, taking a step
007744 forward and shaking his hunting-crop. "I know you, you scoundrel!
007745 I have heard of you before. You are Holmes, the meddler."
007746 
007747 My friend smiled.
007748 
007749 "Holmes, the busybody!"
007750 
007751 His smile broadened.
007752 
007753 "Holmes, the Scotland Yard Jack-in-office!"
007754 
007755 Holmes chuckled heartily. "Your conversation is most
007756 entertaining," said he. "When you go out close the door, for
007757 there is a decided draught."
007758 
007759 "I will go when I have said my say. Don't you dare to meddle with
007760 my affairs. I know that Miss Stoner has been here. I traced her!
007761 I am a dangerous man to fall foul of! See here." He stepped
007762 swiftly forward, seized the poker, and bent it into a curve with
007763 his huge brown hands.
007764 
007765 "See that you keep yourself out of my grip," he snarled, and
007766 hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the
007767 room.
007768 
007769 "He seems a very amiable person," said Holmes, laughing. "I am
007770 not quite so bulky, but if he had remained I might have shown him
007771 that my grip was not much more feeble than his own." As he spoke
007772 he picked up the steel poker and, with a sudden effort,
007773 straightened it out again.
007774 
007775 "Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official
007776 detective force! This incident gives zest to our investigation,
007777 however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer
007778 from her imprudence in allowing this brute to trace her. And now,
007779 Watson, we shall order breakfast, and afterwards I shall walk
007780 down to Doctors' Commons, where I hope to get some data which may
007781 help us in this matter."
007782 
007783 
007784 It was nearly one o'clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his
007785 excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled
007786 over with notes and figures.
007787 
007788 "I have seen the will of the deceased wife," said he. "To
007789 determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the
007790 present prices of the investments with which it is concerned. The
007791 total income, which at the time of the wife's death was little
007792 short of 1100 pounds, is now, through the fall in agricultural
007793 prices, not more than 750 pounds. Each daughter can claim an
007794 income of 250 pounds, in case of marriage. It is evident,
007795 therefore, that if both girls had married, this beauty would have
007796 had a mere pittance, while even one of them would cripple him to
007797 a very serious extent. My morning's work has not been wasted,
007798 since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for
007799 standing in the way of anything of the sort. And now, Watson,
007800 this is too serious for dawdling, especially as the old man is
007801 aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs; so if you
007802 are ready, we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo. I should be
007803 very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your
007804 pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen
007805 who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush
007806 are, I think, all that we need."
007807 
007808 At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for
007809 Leatherhead, where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove
007810 for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes. It was a
007811 perfect day, with a bright sun and a few fleecy clouds in the
007812 heavens. The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out
007813 their first green shoots, and the air was full of the pleasant
007814 smell of the moist earth. To me at least there was a strange
007815 contrast between the sweet promise of the spring and this
007816 sinister quest upon which we were engaged. My companion sat in
007817 the front of the trap, his arms folded, his hat pulled down over
007818 his eyes, and his chin sunk upon his breast, buried in the
007819 deepest thought. Suddenly, however, he started, tapped me on the
007820 shoulder, and pointed over the meadows.
007821 
007822 "Look there!" said he.
007823 
007824 A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope,
007825 thickening into a grove at the highest point. From amid the
007826 branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof-tree of a
007827 very old mansion.
007828 
007829 "Stoke Moran?" said he.
007830 
007831 "Yes, sir, that be the house of Dr. Grimesby Roylott," remarked
007832 the driver.
007833 
007834 "There is some building going on there," said Holmes; "that is
007835 where we are going."
007836 
007837 "There's the village," said the driver, pointing to a cluster of
007838 roofs some distance to the left; "but if you want to get to the
007839 house, you'll find it shorter to get over this stile, and so by
007840 the foot-path over the fields. There it is, where the lady is
007841 walking."
007842 
007843 "And the lady, I fancy, is Miss Stoner," observed Holmes, shading
007844 his eyes. "Yes, I think we had better do as you suggest."
007845 
007846 We got off, paid our fare, and the trap rattled back on its way
007847 to Leatherhead.
007848 
007849 "I thought it as well," said Holmes as we climbed the stile,
007850 "that this fellow should think we had come here as architects, or
007851 on some definite business. It may stop his gossip.
007852 Good-afternoon, Miss Stoner. You see that we have been as good as
007853 our word."
007854 
007855 Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a
007856 face which spoke her joy. "I have been waiting so eagerly for
007857 you," she cried, shaking hands with us warmly. "All has turned
007858 out splendidly. Dr. Roylott has gone to town, and it is unlikely
007859 that he will be back before evening."
007860 
007861 "We have had the pleasure of making the doctor's acquaintance,"
007862 said Holmes, and in a few words he sketched out what had
007863 occurred. Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened.
007864 
007865 "Good heavens!" she cried, "he has followed me, then."
007866 
007867 "So it appears."
007868 
007869 "He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him. What
007870 will he say when he returns?"
007871 
007872 "He must guard himself, for he may find that there is someone
007873 more cunning than himself upon his track. You must lock yourself
007874 up from him to-night. If he is violent, we shall take you away to
007875 your aunt's at Harrow. Now, we must make the best use of our
007876 time, so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to
007877 examine."
007878 
007879 The building was of grey, lichen-blotched stone, with a high
007880 central portion and two curving wings, like the claws of a crab,
007881 thrown out on each side. In one of these wings the windows were
007882 broken and blocked with wooden boards, while the roof was partly
007883 caved in, a picture of ruin. The central portion was in little
007884 better repair, but the right-hand block was comparatively modern,
007885 and the blinds in the windows, with the blue smoke curling up
007886 from the chimneys, showed that this was where the family resided.
007887 Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall, and the
007888 stone-work had been broken into, but there were no signs of any
007889 workmen at the moment of our visit. Holmes walked slowly up and
007890 down the ill-trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the
007891 outsides of the windows.
007892 
007893 "This, I take it, belongs to the room in which you used to sleep,
007894 the centre one to your sister's, and the one next to the main
007895 building to Dr. Roylott's chamber?"
007896 
007897 "Exactly so. But I am now sleeping in the middle one."
007898 
007899 "Pending the alterations, as I understand. By the way, there does
007900 not seem to be any very pressing need for repairs at that end
007901 wall."
007902 
007903 "There were none. I believe that it was an excuse to move me from
007904 my room."
007905 
007906 "Ah! that is suggestive. Now, on the other side of this narrow
007907 wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open. There
007908 are windows in it, of course?"
007909 
007910 "Yes, but very small ones. Too narrow for anyone to pass
007911 through."
007912 
007913 "As you both locked your doors at night, your rooms were
007914 unapproachable from that side. Now, would you have the kindness
007915 to go into your room and bar your shutters?"
007916 
007917 Miss Stoner did so, and Holmes, after a careful examination
007918 through the open window, endeavoured in every way to force the
007919 shutter open, but without success. There was no slit through
007920 which a knife could be passed to raise the bar. Then with his
007921 lens he tested the hinges, but they were of solid iron, built
007922 firmly into the massive masonry. "Hum!" said he, scratching his
007923 chin in some perplexity, "my theory certainly presents some
007924 difficulties. No one could pass these shutters if they were
007925 bolted. Well, we shall see if the inside throws any light upon
007926 the matter."
007927 
007928 A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which
007929 the three bedrooms opened. Holmes refused to examine the third
007930 chamber, so we passed at once to the second, that in which Miss
007931 Stoner was now sleeping, and in which her sister had met with her
007932 fate. It was a homely little room, with a low ceiling and a
007933 gaping fireplace, after the fashion of old country-houses. A
007934 brown chest of drawers stood in one corner, a narrow
007935 white-counterpaned bed in another, and a dressing-table on the
007936 left-hand side of the window. These articles, with two small
007937 wicker-work chairs, made up all the furniture in the room save
007938 for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre. The boards round and
007939 the panelling of the walls were of brown, worm-eaten oak, so old
007940 and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building
007941 of the house. Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat
007942 silent, while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down,
007943 taking in every detail of the apartment.
007944 
007945 "Where does that bell communicate with?" he asked at last
007946 pointing to a thick bell-rope which hung down beside the bed, the
007947 tassel actually lying upon the pillow.
007948 
007949 "It goes to the housekeeper's room."
007950 
007951 "It looks newer than the other things?"
007952 
007953 "Yes, it was only put there a couple of years ago."
007954 
007955 "Your sister asked for it, I suppose?"
007956 
007957 "No, I never heard of her using it. We used always to get what we
007958 wanted for ourselves."
007959 
007960 "Indeed, it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell-pull there.
007961 You will excuse me for a few minutes while I satisfy myself as to
007962 this floor." He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in
007963 his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward, examining
007964 minutely the cracks between the boards. Then he did the same with
007965 the wood-work with which the chamber was panelled. Finally he
007966 walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and
007967 in running his eye up and down the wall. Finally he took the
007968 bell-rope in his hand and gave it a brisk tug.
007969 
007970 "Why, it's a dummy," said he.
007971 
007972 "Won't it ring?"
007973 
007974 "No, it is not even attached to a wire. This is very interesting.
007975 You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just above where
007976 the little opening for the ventilator is."
007977 
007978 "How very absurd! I never noticed that before."
007979 
007980 "Very strange!" muttered Holmes, pulling at the rope. "There are
007981 one or two very singular points about this room. For example,
007982 what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another
007983 room, when, with the same trouble, he might have communicated
007984 with the outside air!"
007985 
007986 "That is also quite modern," said the lady.
007987 
007988 "Done about the same time as the bell-rope?" remarked Holmes.
007989 
007990 "Yes, there were several little changes carried out about that
007991 time."
007992 
007993 "They seem to have been of a most interesting character--dummy
007994 bell-ropes, and ventilators which do not ventilate. With your
007995 permission, Miss Stoner, we shall now carry our researches into
007996 the inner apartment."
007997 
007998 Dr. Grimesby Roylott's chamber was larger than that of his
007999 step-daughter, but was as plainly furnished. A camp-bed, a small
008000 wooden shelf full of books, mostly of a technical character, an
008001 armchair beside the bed, a plain wooden chair against the wall, a
008002 round table, and a large iron safe were the principal things
008003 which met the eye. Holmes walked slowly round and examined each
008004 and all of them with the keenest interest.
008005 
008006 "What's in here?" he asked, tapping the safe.
008007 
008008 "My stepfather's business papers."
008009 
008010 "Oh! you have seen inside, then?"
008011 
008012 "Only once, some years ago. I remember that it was full of
008013 papers."
008014 
008015 "There isn't a cat in it, for example?"
008016 
008017 "No. What a strange idea!"
008018 
008019 "Well, look at this!" He took up a small saucer of milk which
008020 stood on the top of it.
008021 
008022 "No; we don't keep a cat. But there is a cheetah and a baboon."
008023 
008024 "Ah, yes, of course! Well, a cheetah is just a big cat, and yet a
008025 saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying its wants, I
008026 daresay. There is one point which I should wish to determine." He
008027 squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat
008028 of it with the greatest attention.
008029 
008030 "Thank you. That is quite settled," said he, rising and putting
008031 his lens in his pocket. "Hullo! Here is something interesting!"
008032 
008033 The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on
008034 one corner of the bed. The lash, however, was curled upon itself
008035 and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord.
008036 
008037 "What do you make of that, Watson?"
008038 
008039 "It's a common enough lash. But I don't know why it should be
008040 tied."
008041 
008042 "That is not quite so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world,
008043 and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst
008044 of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and
008045 with your permission we shall walk out upon the lawn."
008046 
008047 I had never seen my friend's face so grim or his brow so dark as
008048 it was when we turned from the scene of this investigation. We
008049 had walked several times up and down the lawn, neither Miss
008050 Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he
008051 roused himself from his reverie.
008052 
008053 "It is very essential, Miss Stoner," said he, "that you should
008054 absolutely follow my advice in every respect."
008055 
008056 "I shall most certainly do so."
008057 
008058 "The matter is too serious for any hesitation. Your life may
008059 depend upon your compliance."
008060 
008061 "I assure you that I am in your hands."
008062 
008063 "In the first place, both my friend and I must spend the night in
008064 your room."
008065 
008066 Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment.
008067 
008068 "Yes, it must be so. Let me explain. I believe that that is the
008069 village inn over there?"
008070 
008071 "Yes, that is the Crown."
008072 
008073 "Very good. Your windows would be visible from there?"
008074 
008075 "Certainly."
008076 
008077 "You must confine yourself to your room, on pretence of a
008078 headache, when your stepfather comes back. Then when you hear him
008079 retire for the night, you must open the shutters of your window,
008080 undo the hasp, put your lamp there as a signal to us, and then
008081 withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want
008082 into the room which you used to occupy. I have no doubt that, in
008083 spite of the repairs, you could manage there for one night."
008084 
008085 "Oh, yes, easily."
008086 
008087 "The rest you will leave in our hands."
008088 
008089 "But what will you do?"
008090 
008091 "We shall spend the night in your room, and we shall investigate
008092 the cause of this noise which has disturbed you."
008093 
008094 "I believe, Mr. Holmes, that you have already made up your mind,"
008095 said Miss Stoner, laying her hand upon my companion's sleeve.
008096 
008097 "Perhaps I have."
008098 
008099 "Then, for pity's sake, tell me what was the cause of my sister's
008100 death."
008101 
008102 "I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak."
008103 
008104 "You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct, and
008105 if she died from some sudden fright."
008106 
008107 "No, I do not think so. I think that there was probably some more
008108 tangible cause. And now, Miss Stoner, we must leave you for if
008109 Dr. Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain.
008110 Good-bye, and be brave, for if you will do what I have told you,
008111 you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers
008112 that threaten you."
008113 
008114 Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and
008115 sitting-room at the Crown Inn. They were on the upper floor, and
008116 from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate, and
008117 of the inhabited wing of Stoke Moran Manor House. At dusk we saw
008118 Dr. Grimesby Roylott drive past, his huge form looming up beside
008119 the little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some
008120 slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron gates, and we heard
008121 the hoarse roar of the doctor's voice and saw the fury with which
008122 he shook his clinched fists at him. The trap drove on, and a few
008123 minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as
008124 the lamp was lit in one of the sitting-rooms.
008125 
008126 "Do you know, Watson," said Holmes as we sat together in the
008127 gathering darkness, "I have really some scruples as to taking you
008128 to-night. There is a distinct element of danger."
008129 
008130 "Can I be of assistance?"
008131 
008132 "Your presence might be invaluable."
008133 
008134 "Then I shall certainly come."
008135 
008136 "It is very kind of you."
008137 
008138 "You speak of danger. You have evidently seen more in these rooms
008139 than was visible to me."
008140 
008141 "No, but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more. I imagine
008142 that you saw all that I did."
008143 
008144 "I saw nothing remarkable save the bell-rope, and what purpose
008145 that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine."
008146 
008147 "You saw the ventilator, too?"
008148 
008149 "Yes, but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to
008150 have a small opening between two rooms. It was so small that a
008151 rat could hardly pass through."
008152 
008153 "I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to
008154 Stoke Moran."
008155 
008156 "My dear Holmes!"
008157 
008158 "Oh, yes, I did. You remember in her statement she said that her
008159 sister could smell Dr. Roylott's cigar. Now, of course that
008160 suggested at once that there must be a communication between the
008161 two rooms. It could only be a small one, or it would have been
008162 remarked upon at the coroner's inquiry. I deduced a ventilator."
008163 
008164 "But what harm can there be in that?"
008165 
008166 "Well, there is at least a curious coincidence of dates. A
008167 ventilator is made, a cord is hung, and a lady who sleeps in the
008168 bed dies. Does not that strike you?"
008169 
008170 "I cannot as yet see any connection."
008171 
008172 "Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed?"
008173 
008174 "No."
008175 
008176 "It was clamped to the floor. Did you ever see a bed fastened
008177 like that before?"
008178 
008179 "I cannot say that I have."
008180 
008181 "The lady could not move her bed. It must always be in the same
008182 relative position to the ventilator and to the rope--or so we may
008183 call it, since it was clearly never meant for a bell-pull."
008184 
008185 "Holmes," I cried, "I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at.
008186 We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible
008187 crime."
008188 
008189 "Subtle enough and horrible enough. When a doctor does go wrong
008190 he is the first of criminals. He has nerve and he has knowledge.
008191 Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession.
008192 This man strikes even deeper, but I think, Watson, that we shall
008193 be able to strike deeper still. But we shall have horrors enough
008194 before the night is over; for goodness' sake let us have a quiet
008195 pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something more
008196 cheerful."
008197 
008198 
008199 About nine o'clock the light among the trees was extinguished,
008200 and all was dark in the direction of the Manor House. Two hours
008201 passed slowly away, and then, suddenly, just at the stroke of
008202 eleven, a single bright light shone out right in front of us.
008203 
008204 "That is our signal," said Holmes, springing to his feet; "it
008205 comes from the middle window."
008206 
008207 As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord,
008208 explaining that we were going on a late visit to an acquaintance,
008209 and that it was possible that we might spend the night there. A
008210 moment later we were out on the dark road, a chill wind blowing
008211 in our faces, and one yellow light twinkling in front of us
008212 through the gloom to guide us on our sombre errand.
008213 
008214 There was little difficulty in entering the grounds, for
008215 unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall. Making our way
008216 among the trees, we reached the lawn, crossed it, and were about
008217 to enter through the window when out from a clump of laurel
008218 bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted
008219 child, who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and
008220 then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness.
008221 
008222 "My God!" I whispered; "did you see it?"
008223 
008224 Holmes was for the moment as startled as I. His hand closed like
008225 a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low
008226 laugh and put his lips to my ear.
008227 
008228 "It is a nice household," he murmured. "That is the baboon."
008229 
008230 I had forgotten the strange pets which the doctor affected. There
008231 was a cheetah, too; perhaps we might find it upon our shoulders
008232 at any moment. I confess that I felt easier in my mind when,
008233 after following Holmes' example and slipping off my shoes, I
008234 found myself inside the bedroom. My companion noiselessly closed
008235 the shutters, moved the lamp onto the table, and cast his eyes
008236 round the room. All was as we had seen it in the daytime. Then
008237 creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand, he whispered
008238 into my ear again so gently that it was all that I could do to
008239 distinguish the words:
008240 
008241 "The least sound would be fatal to our plans."
008242 
008243 I nodded to show that I had heard.
008244 
008245 "We must sit without light. He would see it through the
008246 ventilator."
008247 
008248 I nodded again.
008249 
008250 "Do not go asleep; your very life may depend upon it. Have your
008251 pistol ready in case we should need it. I will sit on the side of
008252 the bed, and you in that chair."
008253 
008254 I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table.
008255 
008256 Holmes had brought up a long thin cane, and this he placed upon
008257 the bed beside him. By it he laid the box of matches and the
008258 stump of a candle. Then he turned down the lamp, and we were left
008259 in darkness.
008260 
008261 How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil? I could not hear a
008262 sound, not even the drawing of a breath, and yet I knew that my
008263 companion sat open-eyed, within a few feet of me, in the same
008264 state of nervous tension in which I was myself. The shutters cut
008265 off the least ray of light, and we waited in absolute darkness.
008266 
008267 From outside came the occasional cry of a night-bird, and once at
008268 our very window a long drawn catlike whine, which told us that
008269 the cheetah was indeed at liberty. Far away we could hear the
008270 deep tones of the parish clock, which boomed out every quarter of
008271 an hour. How long they seemed, those quarters! Twelve struck, and
008272 one and two and three, and still we sat waiting silently for
008273 whatever might befall.
008274 
008275 Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the
008276 direction of the ventilator, which vanished immediately, but was
008277 succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal.
008278 Someone in the next room had lit a dark-lantern. I heard a gentle
008279 sound of movement, and then all was silent once more, though the
008280 smell grew stronger. For half an hour I sat with straining ears.
008281 Then suddenly another sound became audible--a very gentle,
008282 soothing sound, like that of a small jet of steam escaping
008283 continually from a kettle. The instant that we heard it, Holmes
008284 sprang from the bed, struck a match, and lashed furiously with
008285 his cane at the bell-pull.
008286 
008287 "You see it, Watson?" he yelled. "You see it?"
008288 
008289 But I saw nothing. At the moment when Holmes struck the light I
008290 heard a low, clear whistle, but the sudden glare flashing into my
008291 weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which
008292 my friend lashed so savagely. I could, however, see that his face
008293 was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing. He had
008294 ceased to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when
008295 suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most
008296 horrible cry to which I have ever listened. It swelled up louder
008297 and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled
008298 in the one dreadful shriek. They say that away down in the
008299 village, and even in the distant parsonage, that cry raised the
008300 sleepers from their beds. It struck cold to our hearts, and I
008301 stood gazing at Holmes, and he at me, until the last echoes of it
008302 had died away into the silence from which it rose.
008303 
008304 "What can it mean?" I gasped.
008305 
008306 "It means that it is all over," Holmes answered. "And perhaps,
008307 after all, it is for the best. Take your pistol, and we will
008308 enter Dr. Roylott's room."
008309 
008310 With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the
008311 corridor. Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply
008312 from within. Then he turned the handle and entered, I at his
008313 heels, with the cocked pistol in my hand.
008314 
008315 It was a singular sight which met our eyes. On the table stood a
008316 dark-lantern with the shutter half open, throwing a brilliant
008317 beam of light upon the iron safe, the door of which was ajar.
008318 Beside this table, on the wooden chair, sat Dr. Grimesby Roylott
008319 clad in a long grey dressing-gown, his bare ankles protruding
008320 beneath, and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers.
008321 Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which we
008322 had noticed during the day. His chin was cocked upward and his
008323 eyes were fixed in a dreadful, rigid stare at the corner of the
008324 ceiling. Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band, with
008325 brownish speckles, which seemed to be bound tightly round his
008326 head. As we entered he made neither sound nor motion.
008327 
008328 "The band! the speckled band!" whispered Holmes.
008329 
008330 I took a step forward. In an instant his strange headgear began
008331 to move, and there reared itself from among his hair the squat
008332 diamond-shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent.
008333 
008334 "It is a swamp adder!" cried Holmes; "the deadliest snake in
008335 India. He has died within ten seconds of being bitten. Violence
008336 does, in truth, recoil upon the violent, and the schemer falls
008337 into the pit which he digs for another. Let us thrust this
008338 creature back into its den, and we can then remove Miss Stoner to
008339 some place of shelter and let the county police know what has
008340 happened."
008341 
008342 As he spoke he drew the dog-whip swiftly from the dead man's lap,
008343 and throwing the noose round the reptile's neck he drew it from
008344 its horrid perch and, carrying it at arm's length, threw it into
008345 the iron safe, which he closed upon it.
008346 
008347 Such are the true facts of the death of Dr. Grimesby Roylott, of
008348 Stoke Moran. It is not necessary that I should prolong a
008349 narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling
008350 how we broke the sad news to the terrified girl, how we conveyed
008351 her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow,
008352 of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the
008353 conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly
008354 playing with a dangerous pet. The little which I had yet to learn
008355 of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back
008356 next day.
008357 
008358 "I had," said he, "come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which
008359 shows, my dear Watson, how dangerous it always is to reason from
008360 insufficient data. The presence of the gipsies, and the use of
008361 the word 'band,' which was used by the poor girl, no doubt, to
008362 explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of
008363 by the light of her match, were sufficient to put me upon an
008364 entirely wrong scent. I can only claim the merit that I instantly
008365 reconsidered my position when, however, it became clear to me
008366 that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not
008367 come either from the window or the door. My attention was
008368 speedily drawn, as I have already remarked to you, to this
008369 ventilator, and to the bell-rope which hung down to the bed. The
008370 discovery that this was a dummy, and that the bed was clamped to
008371 the floor, instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was
008372 there as a bridge for something passing through the hole and
008373 coming to the bed. The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me,
008374 and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was
008375 furnished with a supply of creatures from India, I felt that I
008376 was probably on the right track. The idea of using a form of
008377 poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical
008378 test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless
008379 man who had had an Eastern training. The rapidity with which such
008380 a poison would take effect would also, from his point of view, be
008381 an advantage. It would be a sharp-eyed coroner, indeed, who could
008382 distinguish the two little dark punctures which would show where
008383 the poison fangs had done their work. Then I thought of the
008384 whistle. Of course he must recall the snake before the morning
008385 light revealed it to the victim. He had trained it, probably by
008386 the use of the milk which we saw, to return to him when summoned.
008387 He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he
008388 thought best, with the certainty that it would crawl down the
008389 rope and land on the bed. It might or might not bite the
008390 occupant, perhaps she might escape every night for a week, but
008391 sooner or later she must fall a victim.
008392 
008393 "I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his
008394 room. An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in
008395 the habit of standing on it, which of course would be necessary
008396 in order that he should reach the ventilator. The sight of the
008397 safe, the saucer of milk, and the loop of whipcord were enough to
008398 finally dispel any doubts which may have remained. The metallic
008399 clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her stepfather
008400 hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant.
008401 Having once made up my mind, you know the steps which I took in
008402 order to put the matter to the proof. I heard the creature hiss
008403 as I have no doubt that you did also, and I instantly lit the
008404 light and attacked it."
008405 
008406 "With the result of driving it through the ventilator."
008407 
008408 "And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master
008409 at the other side. Some of the blows of my cane came home and
008410 roused its snakish temper, so that it flew upon the first person
008411 it saw. In this way I am no doubt indirectly responsible for Dr.
008412 Grimesby Roylott's death, and I cannot say that it is likely to
008413 weigh very heavily upon my conscience."
008414 
008415 
008416 
008417 IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
008418 
008419 Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend, Mr.
008420 Sherlock Holmes, for solution during the years of our intimacy,
008421 there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his
008422 notice--that of Mr. Hatherley's thumb, and that of Colonel
008423 Warburton's madness. Of these the latter may have afforded a
008424 finer field for an acute and original observer, but the other was
008425 so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that
008426 it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record, even if it
008427 gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of
008428 reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results. The story
008429 has, I believe, been told more than once in the newspapers, but,
008430 like all such narratives, its effect is much less striking when
008431 set forth en bloc in a single half-column of print than when the
008432 facts slowly evolve before your own eyes, and the mystery clears
008433 gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads
008434 on to the complete truth. At the time the circumstances made a
008435 deep impression upon me, and the lapse of two years has hardly
008436 served to weaken the effect.
008437 
008438 It was in the summer of '89, not long after my marriage, that the
008439 events occurred which I am now about to summarise. I had returned
008440 to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker
008441 Street rooms, although I continually visited him and occasionally
008442 even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come
008443 and visit us. My practice had steadily increased, and as I
008444 happened to live at no very great distance from Paddington
008445 Station, I got a few patients from among the officials. One of
008446 these, whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease, was
008447 never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send
008448 me on every sufferer over whom he might have any influence.
008449 
008450 One morning, at a little before seven o'clock, I was awakened by
008451 the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come
008452 from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting-room. I
008453 dressed hurriedly, for I knew by experience that railway cases
008454 were seldom trivial, and hastened downstairs. As I descended, my
008455 old ally, the guard, came out of the room and closed the door
008456 tightly behind him.
008457 
008458 "I've got him here," he whispered, jerking his thumb over his
008459 shoulder; "he's all right."
008460 
008461 "What is it, then?" I asked, for his manner suggested that it was
008462 some strange creature which he had caged up in my room.
008463 
008464 "It's a new patient," he whispered. "I thought I'd bring him
008465 round myself; then he couldn't slip away. There he is, all safe
008466 and sound. I must go now, Doctor; I have my dooties, just the
008467 same as you." And off he went, this trusty tout, without even
008468 giving me time to thank him.
008469 
008470 I entered my consulting-room and found a gentleman seated by the
008471 table. He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a
008472 soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books. Round one of
008473 his hands he had a handkerchief wrapped, which was mottled all
008474 over with bloodstains. He was young, not more than
008475 five-and-twenty, I should say, with a strong, masculine face; but
008476 he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who
008477 was suffering from some strong agitation, which it took all his
008478 strength of mind to control.
008479 
008480 "I am sorry to knock you up so early, Doctor," said he, "but I
008481 have had a very serious accident during the night. I came in by
008482 train this morning, and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I
008483 might find a doctor, a worthy fellow very kindly escorted me
008484 here. I gave the maid a card, but I see that she has left it upon
008485 the side-table."
008486 
008487 I took it up and glanced at it. "Mr. Victor Hatherley, hydraulic
008488 engineer, 16A, Victoria Street (3rd floor)." That was the name,
008489 style, and abode of my morning visitor. "I regret that I have
008490 kept you waiting," said I, sitting down in my library-chair. "You
008491 are fresh from a night journey, I understand, which is in itself
008492 a monotonous occupation."
008493 
008494 "Oh, my night could not be called monotonous," said he, and
008495 laughed. He laughed very heartily, with a high, ringing note,
008496 leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides. All my medical
008497 instincts rose up against that laugh.
008498 
008499 "Stop it!" I cried; "pull yourself together!" and I poured out
008500 some water from a caraffe.
008501 
008502 It was useless, however. He was off in one of those hysterical
008503 outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis
008504 is over and gone. Presently he came to himself once more, very
008505 weary and pale-looking.
008506 
008507 "I have been making a fool of myself," he gasped.
008508 
008509 "Not at all. Drink this." I dashed some brandy into the water,
008510 and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks.
008511 
008512 "That's better!" said he. "And now, Doctor, perhaps you would
008513 kindly attend to my thumb, or rather to the place where my thumb
008514 used to be."
008515 
008516 He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand. It gave even
008517 my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it. There were four
008518 protruding fingers and a horrid red, spongy surface where the
008519 thumb should have been. It had been hacked or torn right out from
008520 the roots.
008521 
008522 "Good heavens!" I cried, "this is a terrible injury. It must have
008523 bled considerably."
008524 
008525 "Yes, it did. I fainted when it was done, and I think that I must
008526 have been senseless for a long time. When I came to I found that
008527 it was still bleeding, so I tied one end of my handkerchief very
008528 tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig."
008529 
008530 "Excellent! You should have been a surgeon."
008531 
008532 "It is a question of hydraulics, you see, and came within my own
008533 province."
008534 
008535 "This has been done," said I, examining the wound, "by a very
008536 heavy and sharp instrument."
008537 
008538 "A thing like a cleaver," said he.
008539 
008540 "An accident, I presume?"
008541 
008542 "By no means."
008543 
008544 "What! a murderous attack?"
008545 
008546 "Very murderous indeed."
008547 
008548 "You horrify me."
008549 
008550 I sponged the wound, cleaned it, dressed it, and finally covered
008551 it over with cotton wadding and carbolised bandages. He lay back
008552 without wincing, though he bit his lip from time to time.
008553 
008554 "How is that?" I asked when I had finished.
008555 
008556 "Capital! Between your brandy and your bandage, I feel a new man.
008557 I was very weak, but I have had a good deal to go through."
008558 
008559 "Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter. It is evidently
008560 trying to your nerves."
008561 
008562 "Oh, no, not now. I shall have to tell my tale to the police;
008563 but, between ourselves, if it were not for the convincing
008564 evidence of this wound of mine, I should be surprised if they
008565 believed my statement, for it is a very extraordinary one, and I
008566 have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up; and,
008567 even if they believe me, the clues which I can give them are so
008568 vague that it is a question whether justice will be done."
008569 
008570 "Ha!" cried I, "if it is anything in the nature of a problem
008571 which you desire to see solved, I should strongly recommend you
008572 to come to my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, before you go to the
008573 official police."
008574 
008575 "Oh, I have heard of that fellow," answered my visitor, "and I
008576 should be very glad if he would take the matter up, though of
008577 course I must use the official police as well. Would you give me
008578 an introduction to him?"
008579 
008580 "I'll do better. I'll take you round to him myself."
008581 
008582 "I should be immensely obliged to you."
008583 
008584 "We'll call a cab and go together. We shall just be in time to
008585 have a little breakfast with him. Do you feel equal to it?"
008586 
008587 "Yes; I shall not feel easy until I have told my story."
008588 
008589 "Then my servant will call a cab, and I shall be with you in an
008590 instant." I rushed upstairs, explained the matter shortly to my
008591 wife, and in five minutes was inside a hansom, driving with my
008592 new acquaintance to Baker Street.
008593 
008594 Sherlock Holmes was, as I expected, lounging about his
008595 sitting-room in his dressing-gown, reading the agony column of The
008596 Times and smoking his before-breakfast pipe, which was composed
008597 of all the plugs and dottles left from his smokes of the day
008598 before, all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the
008599 mantelpiece. He received us in his quietly genial fashion,
008600 ordered fresh rashers and eggs, and joined us in a hearty meal.
008601 When it was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the
008602 sofa, placed a pillow beneath his head, and laid a glass of
008603 brandy and water within his reach.
008604 
008605 "It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one,
008606 Mr. Hatherley," said he. "Pray, lie down there and make yourself
008607 absolutely at home. Tell us what you can, but stop when you are
008608 tired and keep up your strength with a little stimulant."
008609 
008610 "Thank you," said my patient, "but I have felt another man since
008611 the doctor bandaged me, and I think that your breakfast has
008612 completed the cure. I shall take up as little of your valuable
008613 time as possible, so I shall start at once upon my peculiar
008614 experiences."
008615 
008616 Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary, heavy-lidded
008617 expression which veiled his keen and eager nature, while I sat
008618 opposite to him, and we listened in silence to the strange story
008619 which our visitor detailed to us.
008620 
008621 "You must know," said he, "that I am an orphan and a bachelor,
008622 residing alone in lodgings in London. By profession I am a
008623 hydraulic engineer, and I have had considerable experience of my
008624 work during the seven years that I was apprenticed to Venner &
008625 Matheson, the well-known firm, of Greenwich. Two years ago,
008626 having served my time, and having also come into a fair sum of
008627 money through my poor father's death, I determined to start in
008628 business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria
008629 Street.
008630 
008631 "I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in
008632 business a dreary experience. To me it has been exceptionally so.
008633 During two years I have had three consultations and one small
008634 job, and that is absolutely all that my profession has brought
008635 me. My gross takings amount to 27 pounds 10s. Every day, from
008636 nine in the morning until four in the afternoon, I waited in my
008637 little den, until at last my heart began to sink, and I came to
008638 believe that I should never have any practice at all.
008639 
008640 "Yesterday, however, just as I was thinking of leaving the
008641 office, my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who
008642 wished to see me upon business. He brought up a card, too, with
008643 the name of 'Colonel Lysander Stark' engraved upon it. Close at
008644 his heels came the colonel himself, a man rather over the middle
008645 size, but of an exceeding thinness. I do not think that I have
008646 ever seen so thin a man. His whole face sharpened away into nose
008647 and chin, and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over
008648 his outstanding bones. Yet this emaciation seemed to be his
008649 natural habit, and due to no disease, for his eye was bright, his
008650 step brisk, and his bearing assured. He was plainly but neatly
008651 dressed, and his age, I should judge, would be nearer forty than
008652 thirty.
008653 
008654 "'Mr. Hatherley?' said he, with something of a German accent.
008655 'You have been recommended to me, Mr. Hatherley, as being a man
008656 who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet
008657 and capable of preserving a secret.'
008658 
008659 "I bowed, feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an
008660 address. 'May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character?'
008661 
008662 "'Well, perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just
008663 at this moment. I have it from the same source that you are both
008664 an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London.'
008665 
008666 "'That is quite correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if
008667 I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional
008668 qualifications. I understand that it was on a professional matter
008669 that you wished to speak to me?'
008670 
008671 "'Undoubtedly so. But you will find that all I say is really to
008672 the point. I have a professional commission for you, but absolute
008673 secrecy is quite essential--absolute secrecy, you understand, and
008674 of course we may expect that more from a man who is alone than
008675 from one who lives in the bosom of his family.'
008676 
008677 "'If I promise to keep a secret,' said I, 'you may absolutely
008678 depend upon my doing so.'
008679 
008680 "He looked very hard at me as I spoke, and it seemed to me that I
008681 had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye.
008682 
008683 "'Do you promise, then?' said he at last.
008684 
008685 "'Yes, I promise.'
008686 
008687 "'Absolute and complete silence before, during, and after? No
008688 reference to the matter at all, either in word or writing?'
008689 
008690 "'I have already given you my word.'
008691 
008692 "'Very good.' He suddenly sprang up, and darting like lightning
008693 across the room he flung open the door. The passage outside was
008694 empty.
008695 
008696 "'That's all right,' said he, coming back. 'I know that clerks are
008697 sometimes curious as to their master's affairs. Now we can talk
008698 in safety.' He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to
008699 stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look.
008700 
008701 "A feeling of repulsion, and of something akin to fear had begun
008702 to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man.
008703 Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from
008704 showing my impatience.
008705 
008706 "'I beg that you will state your business, sir,' said I; 'my time
008707 is of value.' Heaven forgive me for that last sentence, but the
008708 words came to my lips.
008709 
008710 "'How would fifty guineas for a night's work suit you?' he asked.
008711 
008712 "'Most admirably.'
008713 
008714 "'I say a night's work, but an hour's would be nearer the mark. I
008715 simply want your opinion about a hydraulic stamping machine which
008716 has got out of gear. If you show us what is wrong we shall soon
008717 set it right ourselves. What do you think of such a commission as
008718 that?'
008719 
008720 "'The work appears to be light and the pay munificent.'
008721 
008722 "'Precisely so. We shall want you to come to-night by the last
008723 train.'
008724 
008725 "'Where to?'
008726 
008727 "'To Eyford, in Berkshire. It is a little place near the borders
008728 of Oxfordshire, and within seven miles of Reading. There is a
008729 train from Paddington which would bring you there at about
008730 11:15.'
008731 
008732 "'Very good.'
008733 
008734 "'I shall come down in a carriage to meet you.'
008735 
008736 "'There is a drive, then?'
008737 
008738 "'Yes, our little place is quite out in the country. It is a good
008739 seven miles from Eyford Station.'
008740 
008741 "'Then we can hardly get there before midnight. I suppose there
008742 would be no chance of a train back. I should be compelled to stop
008743 the night.'
008744 
008745 "'Yes, we could easily give you a shake-down.'
008746 
008747 "'That is very awkward. Could I not come at some more convenient
008748 hour?'
008749 
008750 "'We have judged it best that you should come late. It is to
008751 recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you, a
008752 young and unknown man, a fee which would buy an opinion from the
008753 very heads of your profession. Still, of course, if you would
008754 like to draw out of the business, there is plenty of time to do
008755 so.'
008756 
008757 "I thought of the fifty guineas, and of how very useful they
008758 would be to me. 'Not at all,' said I, 'I shall be very happy to
008759 accommodate myself to your wishes. I should like, however, to
008760 understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to
008761 do.'
008762 
008763 "'Quite so. It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which
008764 we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity. I
008765 have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all
008766 laid before you. I suppose that we are absolutely safe from
008767 eavesdroppers?'
008768 
008769 "'Entirely.'
008770 
008771 "'Then the matter stands thus. You are probably aware that
008772 fuller's-earth is a valuable product, and that it is only found
008773 in one or two places in England?'
008774 
008775 "'I have heard so.'
008776 
008777 "'Some little time ago I bought a small place--a very small
008778 place--within ten miles of Reading. I was fortunate enough to
008779 discover that there was a deposit of fuller's-earth in one of my
008780 fields. On examining it, however, I found that this deposit was a
008781 comparatively small one, and that it formed a link between two
008782 very much larger ones upon the right and left--both of them,
008783 however, in the grounds of my neighbours. These good people were
008784 absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was
008785 quite as valuable as a gold-mine. Naturally, it was to my
008786 interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value,
008787 but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this. I
008788 took a few of my friends into the secret, however, and they
008789 suggested that we should quietly and secretly work our own little
008790 deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would
008791 enable us to buy the neighbouring fields. This we have now been
008792 doing for some time, and in order to help us in our operations we
008793 erected a hydraulic press. This press, as I have already
008794 explained, has got out of order, and we wish your advice upon the
008795 subject. We guard our secret very jealously, however, and if it
008796 once became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our
008797 little house, it would soon rouse inquiry, and then, if the facts
008798 came out, it would be good-bye to any chance of getting these
008799 fields and carrying out our plans. That is why I have made you
008800 promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are
008801 going to Eyford to-night. I hope that I make it all plain?'
008802 
008803 "'I quite follow you,' said I. 'The only point which I could not
008804 quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press
008805 in excavating fuller's-earth, which, as I understand, is dug out
008806 like gravel from a pit.'
008807 
008808 "'Ah!' said he carelessly, 'we have our own process. We compress
008809 the earth into bricks, so as to remove them without revealing
008810 what they are. But that is a mere detail. I have taken you fully
008811 into my confidence now, Mr. Hatherley, and I have shown you how I
008812 trust you.' He rose as he spoke. 'I shall expect you, then, at
008813 Eyford at 11:15.'
008814 
008815 "'I shall certainly be there.'
008816 
008817 "'And not a word to a soul.' He looked at me with a last long,
008818 questioning gaze, and then, pressing my hand in a cold, dank
008819 grasp, he hurried from the room.
008820 
008821 "Well, when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very
008822 much astonished, as you may both think, at this sudden commission
008823 which had been intrusted to me. On the one hand, of course, I was
008824 glad, for the fee was at least tenfold what I should have asked
008825 had I set a price upon my own services, and it was possible that
008826 this order might lead to other ones. On the other hand, the face
008827 and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant impression upon
008828 me, and I could not think that his explanation of the
008829 fuller's-earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my
008830 coming at midnight, and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell
008831 anyone of my errand. However, I threw all fears to the winds, ate
008832 a hearty supper, drove to Paddington, and started off, having
008833 obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue.
008834 
008835 "At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station.
008836 However, I was in time for the last train to Eyford, and I
008837 reached the little dim-lit station after eleven o'clock. I was the
008838 only passenger who got out there, and there was no one upon the
008839 platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern. As I passed
008840 out through the wicket gate, however, I found my acquaintance of
008841 the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side. Without a
008842 word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage, the door
008843 of which was standing open. He drew up the windows on either
008844 side, tapped on the wood-work, and away we went as fast as the
008845 horse could go."
008846 
008847 "One horse?" interjected Holmes.
008848 
008849 "Yes, only one."
008850 
008851 "Did you observe the colour?"
008852 
008853 "Yes, I saw it by the side-lights when I was stepping into the
008854 carriage. It was a chestnut."
008855 
008856 "Tired-looking or fresh?"
008857 
008858 "Oh, fresh and glossy."
008859 
008860 "Thank you. I am sorry to have interrupted you. Pray continue
008861 your most interesting statement."
008862 
008863 "Away we went then, and we drove for at least an hour. Colonel
008864 Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles, but I
008865 should think, from the rate that we seemed to go, and from the
008866 time that we took, that it must have been nearer twelve. He sat
008867 at my side in silence all the time, and I was aware, more than
008868 once when I glanced in his direction, that he was looking at me
008869 with great intensity. The country roads seem to be not very good
008870 in that part of the world, for we lurched and jolted terribly. I
008871 tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we
008872 were, but they were made of frosted glass, and I could make out
008873 nothing save the occasional bright blur of a passing light. Now
008874 and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the
008875 journey, but the colonel answered only in monosyllables, and the
008876 conversation soon flagged. At last, however, the bumping of the
008877 road was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel-drive,
008878 and the carriage came to a stand. Colonel Lysander Stark sprang
008879 out, and, as I followed after him, pulled me swiftly into a porch
008880 which gaped in front of us. We stepped, as it were, right out of
008881 the carriage and into the hall, so that I failed to catch the
008882 most fleeting glance of the front of the house. The instant that
008883 I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us,
008884 and I heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage
008885 drove away.
008886 
008887 "It was pitch dark inside the house, and the colonel fumbled
008888 about looking for matches and muttering under his breath.
008889 Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage, and a
008890 long, golden bar of light shot out in our direction. It grew
008891 broader, and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand, which she
008892 held above her head, pushing her face forward and peering at us.
008893 I could see that she was pretty, and from the gloss with which
008894 the light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich
008895 material. She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as
008896 though asking a question, and when my companion answered in a
008897 gruff monosyllable she gave such a start that the lamp nearly
008898 fell from her hand. Colonel Stark went up to her, whispered
008899 something in her ear, and then, pushing her back into the room
008900 from whence she had come, he walked towards me again with the
008901 lamp in his hand.
008902 
008903 "'Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a
008904 few minutes,' said he, throwing open another door. It was a
008905 quiet, little, plainly furnished room, with a round table in the
008906 centre, on which several German books were scattered. Colonel
008907 Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the
008908 door. 'I shall not keep you waiting an instant,' said he, and
008909 vanished into the darkness.
008910 
008911 "I glanced at the books upon the table, and in spite of my
008912 ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises
008913 on science, the others being volumes of poetry. Then I walked
008914 across to the window, hoping that I might catch some glimpse of
008915 the country-side, but an oak shutter, heavily barred, was folded
008916 across it. It was a wonderfully silent house. There was an old
008917 clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage, but otherwise
008918 everything was deadly still. A vague feeling of uneasiness began
008919 to steal over me. Who were these German people, and what were
008920 they doing living in this strange, out-of-the-way place? And
008921 where was the place? I was ten miles or so from Eyford, that was
008922 all I knew, but whether north, south, east, or west I had no
008923 idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other large towns,
008924 were within that radius, so the place might not be so secluded,
008925 after all. Yet it was quite certain, from the absolute stillness,
008926 that we were in the country. I paced up and down the room,
008927 humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling
008928 that I was thoroughly earning my fifty-guinea fee.
008929 
008930 "Suddenly, without any preliminary sound in the midst of the
008931 utter stillness, the door of my room swung slowly open. The woman
008932 was standing in the aperture, the darkness of the hall behind
008933 her, the yellow light from my lamp beating upon her eager and
008934 beautiful face. I could see at a glance that she was sick with
008935 fear, and the sight sent a chill to my own heart. She held up one
008936 shaking finger to warn me to be silent, and she shot a few
008937 whispered words of broken English at me, her eyes glancing back,
008938 like those of a frightened horse, into the gloom behind her.
008939 
008940 "'I would go,' said she, trying hard, as it seemed to me, to
008941 speak calmly; 'I would go. I should not stay here. There is no
008942 good for you to do.'
008943 
008944 "'But, madam,' said I, 'I have not yet done what I came for. I
008945 cannot possibly leave until I have seen the machine.'
008946 
008947 "'It is not worth your while to wait,' she went on. 'You can pass
008948 through the door; no one hinders.' And then, seeing that I smiled
008949 and shook my head, she suddenly threw aside her constraint and
008950 made a step forward, with her hands wrung together. 'For the love
008951 of Heaven!' she whispered, 'get away from here before it is too
008952 late!'
008953 
008954 "But I am somewhat headstrong by nature, and the more ready to
008955 engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way. I
008956 thought of my fifty-guinea fee, of my wearisome journey, and of
008957 the unpleasant night which seemed to be before me. Was it all to
008958 go for nothing? Why should I slink away without having carried
008959 out my commission, and without the payment which was my due? This
008960 woman might, for all I knew, be a monomaniac. With a stout
008961 bearing, therefore, though her manner had shaken me more than I
008962 cared to confess, I still shook my head and declared my intention
008963 of remaining where I was. She was about to renew her entreaties
008964 when a door slammed overhead, and the sound of several footsteps
008965 was heard upon the stairs. She listened for an instant, threw up
008966 her hands with a despairing gesture, and vanished as suddenly and
008967 as noiselessly as she had come.
008968 
008969 "The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man
008970 with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double
008971 chin, who was introduced to me as Mr. Ferguson.
008972 
008973 "'This is my secretary and manager,' said the colonel. 'By the
008974 way, I was under the impression that I left this door shut just
008975 now. I fear that you have felt the draught.'
008976 
008977 "'On the contrary,' said I, 'I opened the door myself because I
008978 felt the room to be a little close.'
008979 
008980 "He shot one of his suspicious looks at me. 'Perhaps we had
008981 better proceed to business, then,' said he. 'Mr. Ferguson and I
008982 will take you up to see the machine.'
008983 
008984 "'I had better put my hat on, I suppose.'
008985 
008986 "'Oh, no, it is in the house.'
008987 
008988 "'What, you dig fuller's-earth in the house?'
008989 
008990 "'No, no. This is only where we compress it. But never mind that.
008991 All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us
008992 know what is wrong with it.'
008993 
008994 "We went upstairs together, the colonel first with the lamp, the
008995 fat manager and I behind him. It was a labyrinth of an old house,
008996 with corridors, passages, narrow winding staircases, and little
008997 low doors, the thresholds of which were hollowed out by the
008998 generations who had crossed them. There were no carpets and no
008999 signs of any furniture above the ground floor, while the plaster
009000 was peeling off the walls, and the damp was breaking through in
009001 green, unhealthy blotches. I tried to put on as unconcerned an
009002 air as possible, but I had not forgotten the warnings of the
009003 lady, even though I disregarded them, and I kept a keen eye upon
009004 my two companions. Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent
009005 man, but I could see from the little that he said that he was at
009006 least a fellow-countryman.
009007 
009008 "Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door, which
009009 he unlocked. Within was a small, square room, in which the three
009010 of us could hardly get at one time. Ferguson remained outside,
009011 and the colonel ushered me in.
009012 
009013 "'We are now,' said he, 'actually within the hydraulic press, and
009014 it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were
009015 to turn it on. The ceiling of this small chamber is really the
009016 end of the descending piston, and it comes down with the force of
009017 many tons upon this metal floor. There are small lateral columns
009018 of water outside which receive the force, and which transmit and
009019 multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you. The machine
009020 goes readily enough, but there is some stiffness in the working
009021 of it, and it has lost a little of its force. Perhaps you will
009022 have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set
009023 it right.'
009024 
009025 "I took the lamp from him, and I examined the machine very
009026 thoroughly. It was indeed a gigantic one, and capable of
009027 exercising enormous pressure. When I passed outside, however, and
009028 pressed down the levers which controlled it, I knew at once by
009029 the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage, which allowed
009030 a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders. An
009031 examination showed that one of the india-rubber bands which was
009032 round the head of a driving-rod had shrunk so as not quite to
009033 fill the socket along which it worked. This was clearly the cause
009034 of the loss of power, and I pointed it out to my companions, who
009035 followed my remarks very carefully and asked several practical
009036 questions as to how they should proceed to set it right. When I
009037 had made it clear to them, I returned to the main chamber of the
009038 machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own curiosity.
009039 It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller's-earth
009040 was the merest fabrication, for it would be absurd to suppose
009041 that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a
009042 purpose. The walls were of wood, but the floor consisted of a
009043 large iron trough, and when I came to examine it I could see a
009044 crust of metallic deposit all over it. I had stooped and was
009045 scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a
009046 muttered exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the
009047 colonel looking down at me.
009048 
009049 "'What are you doing there?' he asked.
009050 
009051 "I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as
009052 that which he had told me. 'I was admiring your fuller's-earth,'
009053 said I; 'I think that I should be better able to advise you as to
009054 your machine if I knew what the exact purpose was for which it
009055 was used.'
009056 
009057 "The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of
009058 my speech. His face set hard, and a baleful light sprang up in
009059 his grey eyes.
009060 
009061 "'Very well,' said he, 'you shall know all about the machine.' He
009062 took a step backward, slammed the little door, and turned the key
009063 in the lock. I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle, but it
009064 was quite secure, and did not give in the least to my kicks and
009065 shoves. 'Hullo!' I yelled. 'Hullo! Colonel! Let me out!'
009066 
009067 "And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my
009068 heart into my mouth. It was the clank of the levers and the swish
009069 of the leaking cylinder. He had set the engine at work. The lamp
009070 still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining
009071 the trough. By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming
009072 down upon me, slowly, jerkily, but, as none knew better than
009073 myself, with a force which must within a minute grind me to a
009074 shapeless pulp. I threw myself, screaming, against the door, and
009075 dragged with my nails at the lock. I implored the colonel to let
009076 me out, but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my
009077 cries. The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head, and with
009078 my hand upraised I could feel its hard, rough surface. Then it
009079 flashed through my mind that the pain of my death would depend
009080 very much upon the position in which I met it. If I lay on my
009081 face the weight would come upon my spine, and I shuddered to
009082 think of that dreadful snap. Easier the other way, perhaps; and
009083 yet, had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black
009084 shadow wavering down upon me? Already I was unable to stand
009085 erect, when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope
009086 back to my heart.
009087 
009088 "I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron, the
009089 walls were of wood. As I gave a last hurried glance around, I saw
009090 a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards, which
009091 broadened and broadened as a small panel was pushed backward. For
009092 an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door
009093 which led away from death. The next instant I threw myself
009094 through, and lay half-fainting upon the other side. The panel had
009095 closed again behind me, but the crash of the lamp, and a few
009096 moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal, told me
009097 how narrow had been my escape.
009098 
009099 "I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist, and
009100 I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor,
009101 while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand,
009102 while she held a candle in her right. It was the same good friend
009103 whose warning I had so foolishly rejected.
009104 
009105 "'Come! come!' she cried breathlessly. 'They will be here in a
009106 moment. They will see that you are not there. Oh, do not waste
009107 the so-precious time, but come!'
009108 
009109 "This time, at least, I did not scorn her advice. I staggered to
009110 my feet and ran with her along the corridor and down a winding
009111 stair. The latter led to another broad passage, and just as we
009112 reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of
009113 two voices, one answering the other from the floor on which  we
009114 were and from the one beneath. My guide stopped and looked about
009115 her like one  who is at her wit's end. Then she threw open a door
009116 which led into a bedroom, through the window of which the moon
009117 was shining brightly.
009118 
009119 "'It is your only chance,' said she. 'It is high, but it may be
009120 that you can jump it.'
009121 
009122 "As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the
009123 passage, and I saw the lean figure of Colonel Lysander Stark
009124 rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a
009125 butcher's cleaver in the other. I rushed across the bedroom,
009126 flung open the window, and looked out. How quiet and sweet and
009127 wholesome the garden looked in the moonlight, and it could not be
009128 more than thirty feet down. I clambered out upon the sill, but I
009129 hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between
009130 my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me. If she were ill-used,
009131 then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance.
009132 The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at
009133 the door, pushing his way past her; but she threw her arms round
009134 him and tried to hold him back.
009135 
009136 "'Fritz! Fritz!' she cried in English, 'remember your promise
009137 after the last time. You said it should not be again. He will be
009138 silent! Oh, he will be silent!'
009139 
009140 "'You are mad, Elise!' he shouted, struggling to break away from
009141 her. 'You will be the ruin of us. He has seen too much. Let me
009142 pass, I say!' He dashed her to one side, and, rushing to the
009143 window, cut at me with his heavy weapon. I had let myself go, and
009144 was hanging by the hands to the sill, when his blow fell. I was
009145 conscious of a dull pain, my grip loosened, and I fell into the
009146 garden below.
009147 
009148 "I was shaken but not hurt by the fall; so I picked myself up and
009149 rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run, for I
009150 understood that I was far from being out of danger yet. Suddenly,
009151 however, as I ran, a deadly dizziness and sickness came over me.
009152 I glanced down at my hand, which was throbbing painfully, and
009153 then, for the first time, saw that my thumb had been cut off and
009154 that the blood was pouring from my wound. I endeavoured to tie my
009155 handkerchief round it, but there came a sudden buzzing in my
009156 ears, and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the
009157 rose-bushes.
009158 
009159 "How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell. It must have been
009160 a very long time, for the moon had sunk, and a bright morning was
009161 breaking when I came to myself. My clothes were all sodden with
009162 dew, and my coat-sleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded
009163 thumb. The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the
009164 particulars of my night's adventure, and I sprang to my feet with
009165 the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers. But
009166 to my astonishment, when I came to look round me, neither house
009167 nor garden were to be seen. I had been lying in an angle of the
009168 hedge close by the highroad, and just a little lower down was a
009169 long building, which proved, upon my approaching it, to be the
009170 very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night. Were
009171 it not for the ugly wound upon my hand, all that had passed
009172 during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream.
009173 
009174 "Half dazed, I went into the station and asked about the morning
009175 train. There would be one to Reading in less than an hour. The
009176 same porter was on duty, I found, as had been there when I
009177 arrived. I inquired of him whether he had ever heard of Colonel
009178 Lysander Stark. The name was strange to him. Had he observed a
009179 carriage the night before waiting for me? No, he had not. Was
009180 there a police-station anywhere near? There was one about three
009181 miles off.
009182 
009183 "It was too far for me to go, weak and ill as I was. I determined
009184 to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the
009185 police. It was a little past six when I arrived, so I went first
009186 to have my wound dressed, and then the doctor was kind enough to
009187 bring me along here. I put the case into your hands and shall do
009188 exactly what you advise."
009189 
009190 We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to
009191 this extraordinary narrative. Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down
009192 from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he
009193 placed his cuttings.
009194 
009195 "Here is an advertisement which will interest you," said he. "It
009196 appeared in all the papers about a year ago. Listen to this:
009197 'Lost, on the 9th inst., Mr. Jeremiah Hayling, aged
009198 twenty-six, a hydraulic engineer. Left his lodgings at ten
009199 o'clock at night, and has not been heard of since. Was
009200 dressed in,' etc., etc. Ha! That represents the last time that
009201 the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled, I fancy."
009202 
009203 "Good heavens!" cried my patient. "Then that explains what the
009204 girl said."
009205 
009206 "Undoubtedly. It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and
009207 desperate man, who was absolutely determined that nothing should
009208 stand in the way of his little game, like those out-and-out
009209 pirates who will leave no survivor from a captured ship. Well,
009210 every moment now is precious, so if you feel equal to it we shall
009211 go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for
009212 Eyford."
009213 
009214 Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train
009215 together, bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village.
009216 There were Sherlock Holmes, the hydraulic engineer, Inspector
009217 Bradstreet, of Scotland Yard, a plain-clothes man, and myself.
009218 Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the
009219 seat and was busy with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford
009220 for its centre.
009221 
009222 "There you are," said he. "That circle is drawn at a radius of
009223 ten miles from the village. The place we want must be somewhere
009224 near that line. You said ten miles, I think, sir."
009225 
009226 "It was an hour's good drive."
009227 
009228 "And you think that they brought you back all that way when you
009229 were unconscious?"
009230 
009231 "They must have done so. I have a confused memory, too, of having
009232 been lifted and conveyed somewhere."
009233 
009234 "What I cannot understand," said I, "is why they should have
009235 spared you when they found you lying fainting in the garden.
009236 Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman's entreaties."
009237 
009238 "I hardly think that likely. I never saw a more inexorable face
009239 in my life."
009240 
009241 "Oh, we shall soon clear up all that," said Bradstreet. "Well, I
009242 have drawn my circle, and I only wish I knew at what point upon
009243 it the folk that we are in search of are to be found."
009244 
009245 "I think I could lay my finger on it," said Holmes quietly.
009246 
009247 "Really, now!" cried the inspector, "you have formed your
009248 opinion! Come, now, we shall see who agrees with you. I say it is
009249 south, for the country is more deserted there."
009250 
009251 "And I say east," said my patient.
009252 
009253 "I am for west," remarked the plain-clothes man. "There are
009254 several quiet little villages up there."
009255 
009256 "And I am for north," said I, "because there are no hills there,
009257 and our friend says that he did not notice the carriage go up
009258 any."
009259 
009260 "Come," cried the inspector, laughing; "it's a very pretty
009261 diversity of opinion. We have boxed the compass among us. Who do
009262 you give your casting vote to?"
009263 
009264 "You are all wrong."
009265 
009266 "But we can't all be."
009267 
009268 "Oh, yes, you can. This is my point." He placed his finger in the
009269 centre of the circle. "This is where we shall find them."
009270 
009271 "But the twelve-mile drive?" gasped Hatherley.
009272 
009273 "Six out and six back. Nothing simpler. You say yourself that the
009274 horse was fresh and glossy when you got in. How could it be that
009275 if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads?"
009276 
009277 "Indeed, it is a likely ruse enough," observed Bradstreet
009278 thoughtfully. "Of course there can be no doubt as to the nature
009279 of this gang."
009280 
009281 "None at all," said Holmes. "They are coiners on a large scale,
009282 and have used the machine to form the amalgam which has taken the
009283 place of silver."
009284 
009285 "We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work,"
009286 said the inspector. "They have been turning out half-crowns by
009287 the thousand. We even traced them as far as Reading, but could
009288 get no farther, for they had covered their traces in a way that
009289 showed that they were very old hands. But now, thanks to this
009290 lucky chance, I think that we have got them right enough."
009291 
009292 But the inspector was mistaken, for those criminals were not
009293 destined to fall into the hands of justice. As we rolled into
009294 Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed
009295 up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and
009296 hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape.
009297 
009298 "A house on fire?" asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off
009299 again on its way.
009300 
009301 "Yes, sir!" said the station-master.
009302 
009303 "When did it break out?"
009304 
009305 "I hear that it was during the night, sir, but it has got worse,
009306 and the whole place is in a blaze."
009307 
009308 "Whose house is it?"
009309 
009310 "Dr. Becher's."
009311 
009312 "Tell me," broke in the engineer, "is Dr. Becher a German, very
009313 thin, with a long, sharp nose?"
009314 
009315 The station-master laughed heartily. "No, sir, Dr. Becher is an
009316 Englishman, and there isn't a man in the parish who has a
009317 better-lined waistcoat. But he has a gentleman staying with him,
009318 a patient, as I understand, who is a foreigner, and he looks as
009319 if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm."
009320 
009321 The station-master had not finished his speech before we were all
009322 hastening in the direction of the fire. The road topped a low
009323 hill, and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in
009324 front of us, spouting fire at every chink and window, while in
009325 the garden in front three fire-engines were vainly striving to
009326 keep the flames under.
009327 
009328 "That's it!" cried Hatherley, in intense excitement. "There is
009329 the gravel-drive, and there are the rose-bushes where I lay. That
009330 second window is the one that I jumped from."
009331 
009332 "Well, at least," said Holmes, "you have had your revenge upon
009333 them. There can be no question that it was your oil-lamp which,
009334 when it was crushed in the press, set fire to the wooden walls,
009335 though no doubt they were too excited in the chase after you to
009336 observe it at the time. Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for
009337 your friends of last night, though I very much fear that they are
009338 a good hundred miles off by now."
009339 
009340 And Holmes' fears came to be realised, for from that day to this
009341 no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman, the
009342 sinister German, or the morose Englishman. Early that morning a
009343 peasant had met a cart containing several people and some very
009344 bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading, but
009345 there all traces of the fugitives disappeared, and even Holmes'
009346 ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their
009347 whereabouts.
009348 
009349 The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements
009350 which they had found within, and still more so by discovering a
009351 newly severed human thumb upon a window-sill of the second floor.
009352 About sunset, however, their efforts were at last successful, and
009353 they subdued the flames, but not before the roof had fallen in,
009354 and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that, save
009355 some twisted cylinders and iron piping, not a trace remained of
009356 the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so
009357 dearly. Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored
009358 in an out-house, but no coins were to be found, which may have
009359 explained the presence of those bulky boxes which have been
009360 already referred to.
009361 
009362 How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to
009363 the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained
009364 forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould, which told us a
009365 very plain tale. He had evidently been carried down by two
009366 persons, one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other
009367 unusually large ones. On the whole, it was most probable that the
009368 silent Englishman, being less bold or less murderous than his
009369 companion, had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out
009370 of the way of danger.
009371 
009372 "Well," said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return
009373 once more to London, "it has been a pretty business for me! I
009374 have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty-guinea fee, and what
009375 have I gained?"
009376 
009377 "Experience," said Holmes, laughing. "Indirectly it may be of
009378 value, you know; you have only to put it into words to gain the
009379 reputation of being excellent company for the remainder of your
009380 existence."
009381 
009382 
009383 
009384 X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
009385 
009386 The Lord St. Simon marriage, and its curious termination, have
009387 long ceased to be a subject of interest in those exalted circles
009388 in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves. Fresh scandals have
009389 eclipsed it, and their more piquant details have drawn the
009390 gossips away from this four-year-old drama. As I have reason to
009391 believe, however, that the full facts have never been revealed to
009392 the general public, and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a
009393 considerable share in clearing the matter up, I feel that no
009394 memoir of him would be complete without some little sketch of
009395 this remarkable episode.
009396 
009397 It was a few weeks before my own marriage, during the days when I
009398 was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street, that he came
009399 home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table
009400 waiting for him. I had remained indoors all day, for the weather
009401 had taken a sudden turn to rain, with high autumnal winds, and
009402 the Jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as
009403 a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull persistence.
009404 With my body in one easy-chair and my legs upon another, I had
009405 surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last,
009406 saturated with the news of the day, I tossed them all aside and
009407 lay listless, watching the huge crest and monogram upon the
009408 envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend's
009409 noble correspondent could be.
009410 
009411 "Here is a very fashionable epistle," I remarked as he entered.
009412 "Your morning letters, if I remember right, were from a
009413 fish-monger and a tide-waiter."
009414 
009415 "Yes, my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety," he
009416 answered, smiling, "and the humbler are usually the more
009417 interesting. This looks like one of those unwelcome social
009418 summonses which call upon a man either to be bored or to lie."
009419 
009420 He broke the seal and glanced over the contents.
009421 
009422 "Oh, come, it may prove to be something of interest, after all."
009423 
009424 "Not social, then?"
009425 
009426 "No, distinctly professional."
009427 
009428 "And from a noble client?"
009429 
009430 "One of the highest in England."
009431 
009432 "My dear fellow, I congratulate you."
009433 
009434 "I assure you, Watson, without affectation, that the status of my
009435 client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his
009436 case. It is just possible, however, that that also may not be
009437 wanting in this new investigation. You have been reading the
009438 papers diligently of late, have you not?"
009439 
009440 "It looks like it," said I ruefully, pointing to a huge bundle in
009441 the corner. "I have had nothing else to do."
009442 
009443 "It is fortunate, for you will perhaps be able to post me up. I
009444 read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column. The
009445 latter is always instructive. But if you have followed recent
009446 events so closely you must have read about Lord St. Simon and his
009447 wedding?"
009448 
009449 "Oh, yes, with the deepest interest."
009450 
009451 "That is well. The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord
009452 St. Simon. I will read it to you, and in return you must turn
009453 over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter.
009454 This is what he says:
009455 
009456 "'MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES:--Lord Backwater tells me that I
009457 may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion. I
009458 have determined, therefore, to call upon you and to consult you
009459 in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in
009460 connection with my wedding. Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, is
009461 acting already in the matter, but he assures me that he sees no
009462 objection to your co-operation, and that he even thinks that
009463 it might be of some assistance. I will call at four o'clock in
009464 the afternoon, and, should you have any other engagement at that
009465 time, I hope that you will postpone it, as this matter is of
009466 paramount importance. Yours faithfully, ST. SIMON.'
009467 
009468 "It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions, written with a quill pen,
009469 and the noble lord has had the misfortune to get a smear of ink
009470 upon the outer side of his right little finger," remarked Holmes
009471 as he folded up the epistle.
009472 
009473 "He says four o'clock. It is three now. He will be here in an
009474 hour."
009475 
009476 "Then I have just time, with your assistance, to get clear upon
009477 the subject. Turn over those papers and arrange the extracts in
009478 their order of time, while I take a glance as to who our client
009479 is." He picked a red-covered volume from a line of books of
009480 reference beside the mantelpiece. "Here he is," said he, sitting
009481 down and flattening it out upon his knee. "'Lord Robert Walsingham
009482 de Vere St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral.' Hum! 'Arms:
009483 Azure, three caltrops in chief over a fess sable. Born in 1846.'
009484 He's forty-one years of age, which is mature for marriage. Was
009485 Under-Secretary for the colonies in a late administration. The
009486 Duke, his father, was at one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs.
009487 They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent, and Tudor on
009488 the distaff side. Ha! Well, there is nothing very instructive in
009489 all this. I think that I must turn to you Watson, for something
009490 more solid."
009491 
009492 "I have very little difficulty in finding what I want," said I,
009493 "for the facts are quite recent, and the matter struck me as
009494 remarkable. I feared to refer them to you, however, as I knew
009495 that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the
009496 intrusion of other matters."
009497 
009498 "Oh, you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square
009499 furniture van. That is quite cleared up now--though, indeed, it
009500 was obvious from the first. Pray give me the results of your
009501 newspaper selections."
009502 
009503 "Here is the first notice which I can find. It is in the personal
009504 column of the Morning Post, and dates, as you see, some weeks
009505 back: 'A marriage has been arranged,' it says, 'and will, if
009506 rumour is correct, very shortly take place, between Lord Robert
009507 St. Simon, second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty
009508 Doran, the only daughter of Aloysius Doran. Esq., of San
009509 Francisco, Cal., U.S.A.' That is all."
009510 
009511 "Terse and to the point," remarked Holmes, stretching his long,
009512 thin legs towards the fire.
009513 
009514 "There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society
009515 papers of the same week. Ah, here it is: 'There will soon be a
009516 call for protection in the marriage market, for the present
009517 free-trade principle appears to tell heavily against our home
009518 product. One by one the management of the noble houses of Great
009519 Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across
009520 the Atlantic. An important addition has been made during the last
009521 week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by
009522 these charming invaders. Lord St. Simon, who has shown himself
009523 for over twenty years proof against the little god's arrows, has
009524 now definitely announced his approaching marriage with Miss Hatty
009525 Doran, the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire. Miss
009526 Doran, whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much
009527 attention at the Westbury House festivities, is an only child,
009528 and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to
009529 considerably over the six figures, with expectancies for the
009530 future. As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has
009531 been compelled to sell his pictures within the last few years,
009532 and as Lord St. Simon has no property of his own save the small
009533 estate of Birchmoor, it is obvious that the Californian heiress
009534 is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to
009535 make the easy and common transition from a Republican lady to a
009536 British peeress.'"
009537 
009538 "Anything else?" asked Holmes, yawning.
009539 
009540 "Oh, yes; plenty. Then there is another note in the Morning Post
009541 to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one, that it
009542 would be at St. George's, Hanover Square, that only half a dozen
009543 intimate friends would be invited, and that the party would
009544 return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been
009545 taken by Mr. Aloysius Doran. Two days later--that is, on
009546 Wednesday last--there is a curt announcement that the wedding had
009547 taken place, and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord
009548 Backwater's place, near Petersfield. Those are all the notices
009549 which appeared before the disappearance of the bride."
009550 
009551 "Before the what?" asked Holmes with a start.
009552 
009553 "The vanishing of the lady."
009554 
009555 "When did she vanish, then?"
009556 
009557 "At the wedding breakfast."
009558 
009559 "Indeed. This is more interesting than it promised to be; quite
009560 dramatic, in fact."
009561 
009562 "Yes; it struck me as being a little out of the common."
009563 
009564 "They often vanish before the ceremony, and occasionally during
009565 the honeymoon; but I cannot call to mind anything quite so prompt
009566 as this. Pray let me have the details."
009567 
009568 "I warn you that they are very incomplete."
009569 
009570 "Perhaps we may make them less so."
009571 
009572 "Such as they are, they are set forth in a single article of a
009573 morning paper of yesterday, which I will read to you. It is
009574 headed, 'Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding':
009575 
009576 "'The family of Lord Robert St. Simon has been thrown into the
009577 greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which
009578 have taken place in connection with his wedding. The ceremony, as
009579 shortly announced in the papers of yesterday, occurred on the
009580 previous morning; but it is only now that it has been possible to
009581 confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently
009582 floating about. In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush
009583 the matter up, so much public attention has now been drawn to it
009584 that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what
009585 is a common subject for conversation.
009586 
009587 "'The ceremony, which was performed at St. George's, Hanover
009588 Square, was a very quiet one, no one being present save the
009589 father of the bride, Mr. Aloysius Doran, the Duchess of Balmoral,
009590 Lord Backwater, Lord Eustace and Lady Clara St. Simon (the
009591 younger brother and sister of the bridegroom), and Lady Alicia
009592 Whittington. The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of
009593 Mr. Aloysius Doran, at Lancaster Gate, where breakfast had been
009594 prepared. It appears that some little trouble was caused by a
009595 woman, whose name has not been ascertained, who endeavoured to
009596 force her way into the house after the bridal party, alleging
009597 that she had some claim upon Lord St. Simon. It was only after a
009598 painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler
009599 and the footman. The bride, who had fortunately entered the house
009600 before this unpleasant interruption, had sat down to breakfast
009601 with the rest, when she complained of a sudden indisposition and
009602 retired to her room. Her prolonged absence having caused some
009603 comment, her father followed her, but learned from her maid that
009604 she had only come up to her chamber for an instant, caught up an
009605 ulster and bonnet, and hurried down to the passage. One of the
009606 footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus
009607 apparelled, but had refused to credit that it was his mistress,
009608 believing her to be with the company. On ascertaining that his
009609 daughter had disappeared, Mr. Aloysius Doran, in conjunction with
009610 the bridegroom, instantly put themselves in communication with
009611 the police, and very energetic inquiries are being made, which
009612 will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very
009613 singular business. Up to a late hour last night, however, nothing
009614 had transpired as to the whereabouts of the missing lady. There
009615 are rumours of foul play in the matter, and it is said that the
009616 police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the
009617 original disturbance, in the belief that, from jealousy or some
009618 other motive, she may have been concerned in the strange
009619 disappearance of the bride.'"
009620 
009621 "And is that all?"
009622 
009623 "Only one little item in another of the morning papers, but it is
009624 a suggestive one."
009625 
009626 "And it is--"
009627 
009628 "That Miss Flora Millar, the lady who had caused the disturbance,
009629 has actually been arrested. It appears that she was formerly a
009630 danseuse at the Allegro, and that she has known the bridegroom
009631 for some years. There are no further particulars, and the whole
009632 case is in your hands now--so far as it has been set forth in the
009633 public press."
009634 
009635 "And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be. I would
009636 not have missed it for worlds. But there is a ring at the bell,
009637 Watson, and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four, I
009638 have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client. Do not
009639 dream of going, Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness,
009640 if only as a check to my own memory."
009641 
009642 "Lord Robert St. Simon," announced our page-boy, throwing open
009643 the door. A gentleman entered, with a pleasant, cultured face,
009644 high-nosed and pale, with something perhaps of petulance about
009645 the mouth, and with the steady, well-opened eye of a man whose
009646 pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed. His
009647 manner was brisk, and yet his general appearance gave an undue
009648 impression of age, for he had a slight forward stoop and a little
009649 bend of the knees as he walked. His hair, too, as he swept off
009650 his very curly-brimmed hat, was grizzled round the edges and thin
009651 upon the top. As to his dress, it was careful to the verge of
009652 foppishness, with high collar, black frock-coat, white waistcoat,
009653 yellow gloves, patent-leather shoes, and light-coloured gaiters.
009654 He advanced slowly into the room, turning his head from left to
009655 right, and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his
009656 golden eyeglasses.
009657 
009658 "Good-day, Lord St. Simon," said Holmes, rising and bowing. "Pray
009659 take the basket-chair. This is my friend and colleague, Dr.
009660 Watson. Draw up a little to the fire, and we will talk this
009661 matter over."
009662 
009663 "A most painful matter to me, as you can most readily imagine,
009664 Mr. Holmes. I have been cut to the quick. I understand that you
009665 have already managed several delicate cases of this sort, sir,
009666 though I presume that they were hardly from the same class of
009667 society."
009668 
009669 "No, I am descending."
009670 
009671 "I beg pardon."
009672 
009673 "My last client of the sort was a king."
009674 
009675 "Oh, really! I had no idea. And which king?"
009676 
009677 "The King of Scandinavia."
009678 
009679 "What! Had he lost his wife?"
009680 
009681 "You can understand," said Holmes suavely, "that I extend to the
009682 affairs of my other clients the same secrecy which I promise to
009683 you in yours."
009684 
009685 "Of course! Very right! very right! I'm sure I beg pardon. As to
009686 my own case, I am ready to give you any information which may
009687 assist you in forming an opinion."
009688 
009689 "Thank you. I have already learned all that is in the public
009690 prints, nothing more. I presume that I may take it as correct--this
009691 article, for example, as to the disappearance of the bride."
009692 
009693 Lord St. Simon glanced over it. "Yes, it is correct, as far as it
009694 goes."
009695 
009696 "But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could
009697 offer an opinion. I think that I may arrive at my facts most
009698 directly by questioning you."
009699 
009700 "Pray do so."
009701 
009702 "When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran?"
009703 
009704 "In San Francisco, a year ago."
009705 
009706 "You were travelling in the States?"
009707 
009708 "Yes."
009709 
009710 "Did you become engaged then?"
009711 
009712 "No."
009713 
009714 "But you were on a friendly footing?"
009715 
009716 "I was amused by her society, and she could see that I was
009717 amused."
009718 
009719 "Her father is very rich?"
009720 
009721 "He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope."
009722 
009723 "And how did he make his money?"
009724 
009725 "In mining. He had nothing a few years ago. Then he struck gold,
009726 invested it, and came up by leaps and bounds."
009727 
009728 "Now, what is your own impression as to the young lady's--your
009729 wife's character?"
009730 
009731 The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down
009732 into the fire. "You see, Mr. Holmes," said he, "my wife was
009733 twenty before her father became a rich man. During that time she
009734 ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or
009735 mountains, so that her education has come from Nature rather than
009736 from the schoolmaster. She is what we call in England a tomboy,
009737 with a strong nature, wild and free, unfettered by any sort of
009738 traditions. She is impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She
009739 is swift in making up her mind and fearless in carrying out her
009740 resolutions. On the other hand, I would not have given her the
009741 name which I have the honour to bear"--he gave a little stately
009742 cough--"had not I thought her to be at bottom a noble woman. I
009743 believe that she is capable of heroic self-sacrifice and that
009744 anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her."
009745 
009746 "Have you her photograph?"
009747 
009748 "I brought this with me." He opened a locket and showed us the
009749 full face of a very lovely woman. It was not a photograph but an
009750 ivory miniature, and the artist had brought out the full effect
009751 of the lustrous black hair, the large dark eyes, and the
009752 exquisite mouth. Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it. Then he
009753 closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St. Simon.
009754 
009755 "The young lady came to London, then, and you renewed your
009756 acquaintance?"
009757 
009758 "Yes, her father brought her over for this last London season. I
009759 met her several times, became engaged to her, and have now
009760 married her."
009761 
009762 "She brought, I understand, a considerable dowry?"
009763 
009764 "A fair dowry. Not more than is usual in my family."
009765 
009766 "And this, of course, remains to you, since the marriage is a
009767 fait accompli?"
009768 
009769 "I really have made no inquiries on the subject."
009770 
009771 "Very naturally not. Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the
009772 wedding?"
009773 
009774 "Yes."
009775 
009776 "Was she in good spirits?"
009777 
009778 "Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our
009779 future lives."
009780 
009781 "Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the
009782 wedding?"
009783 
009784 "She was as bright as possible--at least until after the
009785 ceremony."
009786 
009787 "And did you observe any change in her then?"
009788 
009789 "Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had
009790 ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident
009791 however, was too trivial to relate and can have no possible
009792 bearing upon the case."
009793 
009794 "Pray let us have it, for all that."
009795 
009796 "Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards
009797 the vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it
009798 fell over into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the
009799 gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again, and it did not
009800 appear to be the worse for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of
009801 the matter, she answered me abruptly; and in the carriage, on our
009802 way home, she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause."
009803 
009804 "Indeed! You say that there was a gentleman in the pew. Some of
009805 the general public were present, then?"
009806 
009807 "Oh, yes. It is impossible to exclude them when the church is
009808 open."
009809 
009810 "This gentleman was not one of your wife's friends?"
009811 
009812 "No, no; I call him a gentleman by courtesy, but he was quite a
009813 common-looking person. I hardly noticed his appearance. But
009814 really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point."
009815 
009816 "Lady St. Simon, then, returned from the wedding in a less
009817 cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it. What did she do
009818 on re-entering her father's house?"
009819 
009820 "I saw her in conversation with her maid."
009821 
009822 "And who is her maid?"
009823 
009824 "Alice is her name. She is an American and came from California
009825 with her."
009826 
009827 "A confidential servant?"
009828 
009829 "A little too much so. It seemed to me that her mistress allowed
009830 her to take great liberties. Still, of course, in America they
009831 look upon these things in a different way."
009832 
009833 "How long did she speak to this Alice?"
009834 
009835 "Oh, a few minutes. I had something else to think of."
009836 
009837 "You did not overhear what they said?"
009838 
009839 "Lady St. Simon said something about 'jumping a claim.' She was
009840 accustomed to use slang of the kind. I have no idea what she
009841 meant."
009842 
009843 "American slang is very expressive sometimes. And what did your
009844 wife do when she finished speaking to her maid?"
009845 
009846 "She walked into the breakfast-room."
009847 
009848 "On your arm?"
009849 
009850 "No, alone. She was very independent in little matters like that.
009851 Then, after we had sat down for ten minutes or so, she rose
009852 hurriedly, muttered some words of apology, and left the room. She
009853 never came back."
009854 
009855 "But this maid, Alice, as I understand, deposes that she went to
009856 her room, covered her bride's dress with a long ulster, put on a
009857 bonnet, and went out."
009858 
009859 "Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in
009860 company with Flora Millar, a woman who is now in custody, and who
009861 had already made a disturbance at Mr. Doran's house that
009862 morning."
009863 
009864 "Ah, yes. I should like a few particulars as to this young lady,
009865 and your relations to her."
009866 
009867 Lord St. Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.
009868 "We have been on a friendly footing for some years--I may say on
009869 a very friendly footing. She used to be at the Allegro. I have
009870 not treated her ungenerously, and she had no just cause of
009871 complaint against me, but you know what women are, Mr. Holmes.
009872 Flora was a dear little thing, but exceedingly hot-headed and
009873 devotedly attached to me. She wrote me dreadful letters when she
009874 heard that I was about to be married, and, to tell the truth, the
009875 reason why I had the marriage celebrated so quietly was that I
009876 feared lest there might be a scandal in the church. She came to
009877 Mr. Doran's door just after we returned, and she endeavoured to
009878 push her way in, uttering very abusive expressions towards my
009879 wife, and even threatening her, but I had foreseen the
009880 possibility of something of the sort, and I had two police
009881 fellows there in private clothes, who soon pushed her out again.
009882 She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a
009883 row."
009884 
009885 "Did your wife hear all this?"
009886 
009887 "No, thank goodness, she did not."
009888 
009889 "And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards?"
009890 
009891 "Yes. That is what Mr. Lestrade, of Scotland Yard, looks upon as
009892 so serious. It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid
009893 some terrible trap for her."
009894 
009895 "Well, it is a possible supposition."
009896 
009897 "You think so, too?"
009898 
009899 "I did not say a probable one. But you do not yourself look upon
009900 this as likely?"
009901 
009902 "I do not think Flora would hurt a fly."
009903 
009904 "Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray
009905 what is your own theory as to what took place?"
009906 
009907 "Well, really, I came to seek a theory, not to propound one. I
009908 have given you all the facts. Since you ask me, however, I may
009909 say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of
009910 this affair, the consciousness that she had made so immense a
009911 social stride, had the effect of causing some little nervous
009912 disturbance in my wife."
009913 
009914 "In short, that she had become suddenly deranged?"
009915 
009916 "Well, really, when I consider that she has turned her back--I
009917 will not say upon me, but upon so much that many have aspired to
009918 without success--I can hardly explain it in any other fashion."
009919 
009920 "Well, certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis," said
009921 Holmes, smiling. "And now, Lord St. Simon, I think that I have
009922 nearly all my data. May I ask whether you were seated at the
009923 breakfast-table so that you could see out of the window?"
009924 
009925 "We could see the other side of the road and the Park."
009926 
009927 "Quite so. Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer.
009928 I shall communicate with you."
009929 
009930 "Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem," said our
009931 client, rising.
009932 
009933 "I have solved it."
009934 
009935 "Eh? What was that?"
009936 
009937 "I say that I have solved it."
009938 
009939 "Where, then, is my wife?"
009940 
009941 "That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."
009942 
009943 Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take
009944 wiser heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a
009945 stately, old-fashioned manner he departed.
009946 
009947 "It is very good of Lord St. Simon to honour my head by putting
009948 it on a level with his own," said Sherlock Holmes, laughing. "I
009949 think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all
009950 this cross-questioning. I had formed my conclusions as to the
009951 case before our client came into the room."
009952 
009953 "My dear Holmes!"
009954 
009955 "I have notes of several similar cases, though none, as I
009956 remarked before, which were quite as prompt. My whole examination
009957 served to turn my conjecture into a certainty. Circumstantial
009958 evidence is occasionally very convincing, as when you find a
009959 trout in the milk, to quote Thoreau's example."
009960 
009961 "But I have heard all that you have heard."
009962 
009963 "Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which
009964 serves me so well. There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some
009965 years back, and something on very much the same lines at Munich
009966 the year after the Franco-Prussian War. It is one of these
009967 cases--but, hullo, here is Lestrade! Good-afternoon, Lestrade!
009968 You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard, and there are
009969 cigars in the box."
009970 
009971 The official detective was attired in a pea-jacket and cravat,
009972 which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance, and he carried a
009973 black canvas bag in his hand. With a short greeting he seated
009974 himself and lit the cigar which had been offered to him.
009975 
009976 "What's up, then?" asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye. "You
009977 look dissatisfied."
009978 
009979 "And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage
009980 case. I can make neither head nor tail of the business."
009981 
009982 "Really! You surprise me."
009983 
009984 "Who ever heard of such a mixed affair? Every clue seems to slip
009985 through my fingers. I have been at work upon it all day."
009986 
009987 "And very wet it seems to have made you," said Holmes laying his
009988 hand upon the arm of the pea-jacket.
009989 
009990 "Yes, I have been dragging the Serpentine."
009991 
009992 "In heaven's name, what for?"
009993 
009994 "In search of the body of Lady St. Simon."
009995 
009996 Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily.
009997 
009998 "Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain?" he
009999 asked.
010000 
010001 "Why? What do you mean?"
010002 
010003 "Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in
010004 the one as in the other."
010005 
010006 Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion. "I suppose you
010007 know all about it," he snarled.
010008 
010009 "Well, I have only just heard the facts, but my mind is made up."
010010 
010011 "Oh, indeed! Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in
010012 the matter?"
010013 
010014 "I think it very unlikely."
010015 
010016 "Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found
010017 this in it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the
010018 floor a wedding-dress of watered silk, a pair of white satin
010019 shoes and a bride's wreath and veil, all discoloured and soaked
010020 in water. "There," said he, putting a new wedding-ring upon the
010021 top of the pile. "There is a little nut for you to crack, Master
010022 Holmes."
010023 
010024 "Oh, indeed!" said my friend, blowing blue rings into the air.
010025 "You dragged them from the Serpentine?"
010026 
010027 "No. They were found floating near the margin by a park-keeper.
010028 They have been identified as her clothes, and it seemed to me
010029 that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off."
010030 
010031 "By the same brilliant reasoning, every man's body is to be found
010032 in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe. And pray what did you hope
010033 to arrive at through this?"
010034 
010035 "At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance."
010036 
010037 "I am afraid that you will find it difficult."
010038 
010039 "Are you, indeed, now?" cried Lestrade with some bitterness. "I
010040 am afraid, Holmes, that you are not very practical with your
010041 deductions and your inferences. You have made two blunders in as
010042 many minutes. This dress does implicate Miss Flora Millar."
010043 
010044 "And how?"
010045 
010046 "In the dress is a pocket. In the pocket is a card-case. In the
010047 card-case is a note. And here is the very note." He slapped it
010048 down upon the table in front of him. "Listen to this: 'You will
010049 see me when all is ready. Come at once. F.H.M.' Now my theory all
010050 along has been that Lady St. Simon was decoyed away by Flora
010051 Millar, and that she, with confederates, no doubt, was
010052 responsible for her disappearance. Here, signed with her
010053 initials, is the very note which was no doubt quietly slipped
010054 into her hand at the door and which lured her within their
010055 reach."
010056 
010057 "Very good, Lestrade," said Holmes, laughing. "You really are
010058 very fine indeed. Let me see it." He took up the paper in a
010059 listless way, but his attention instantly became riveted, and he
010060 gave a little cry of satisfaction. "This is indeed important,"
010061 said he.
010062 
010063 "Ha! you find it so?"
010064 
010065 "Extremely so. I congratulate you warmly."
010066 
010067 Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look. "Why," he
010068 shrieked, "you're looking at the wrong side!"
010069 
010070 "On the contrary, this is the right side."
010071 
010072 "The right side? You're mad! Here is the note written in pencil
010073 over here."
010074 
010075 "And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel
010076 bill, which interests me deeply."
010077 
010078 "There's nothing in it. I looked at it before," said Lestrade.
010079 "'Oct. 4th, rooms 8s., breakfast 2s. 6d., cocktail 1s., lunch 2s.
010080 6d., glass sherry, 8d.' I see nothing in that."
010081 
010082 "Very likely not. It is most important, all the same. As to the
010083 note, it is important also, or at least the initials are, so I
010084 congratulate you again."
010085 
010086 "I've wasted time enough," said Lestrade, rising. "I believe in
010087 hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning fine theories.
010088 Good-day, Mr. Holmes, and we shall see which gets to the bottom
010089 of the matter first." He gathered up the garments, thrust them
010090 into the bag, and made for the door.
010091 
010092 "Just one hint to you, Lestrade," drawled Holmes before his rival
010093 vanished; "I will tell you the true solution of the matter. Lady
010094 St. Simon is a myth. There is not, and there never has been, any
010095 such person."
010096 
010097 Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me,
010098 tapped his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and
010099 hurried away.
010100 
010101 He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on
010102 his overcoat. "There is something in what the fellow says about
010103 outdoor work," he remarked, "so I think, Watson, that I must
010104 leave you to your papers for a little."
010105 
010106 It was after five o'clock when Sherlock Holmes left me, but I had
010107 no time to be lonely, for within an hour there arrived a
010108 confectioner's man with a very large flat box. This he unpacked
010109 with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him, and
010110 presently, to my very great astonishment, a quite epicurean
010111 little cold supper began to be laid out upon our humble
010112 lodging-house mahogany. There were a couple of brace of cold
010113 woodcock, a pheasant, a pt de foie gras pie with a group of
010114 ancient and cobwebby bottles. Having laid out all these luxuries,
010115 my two visitors vanished away, like the genii of the Arabian
010116 Nights, with no explanation save that the things had been paid
010117 for and were ordered to this address.
010118 
010119 Just before nine o'clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the
010120 room. His features were gravely set, but there was a light in his
010121 eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his
010122 conclusions.
010123 
010124 "They have laid the supper, then," he said, rubbing his hands.
010125 
010126 "You seem to expect company. They have laid for five."
010127 
010128 "Yes, I fancy we may have some company dropping in," said he. "I
010129 am surprised that Lord St. Simon has not already arrived. Ha! I
010130 fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs."
010131 
010132 It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in,
010133 dangling his glasses more vigorously than ever, and with a very
010134 perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features.
010135 
010136 "My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.
010137 
010138 "Yes, and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure.
010139 Have you good authority for what you say?"
010140 
010141 "The best possible."
010142 
010143 Lord St. Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his
010144 forehead.
010145 
010146 "What will the Duke say," he murmured, "when he hears that one of
010147 the family has been subjected to such humiliation?"
010148 
010149 "It is the purest accident. I cannot allow that there is any
010150 humiliation."
010151 
010152 "Ah, you look on these things from another standpoint."
010153 
010154 "I fail to see that anyone is to blame. I can hardly see how the
010155 lady could have acted otherwise, though her abrupt method of
010156 doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted. Having no mother, she
010157 had no one to advise her at such a crisis."
010158 
010159 "It was a slight, sir, a public slight," said Lord St. Simon,
010160 tapping his fingers upon the table.
010161 
010162 "You must make allowance for this poor girl, placed in so
010163 unprecedented a position."
010164 
010165 "I will make no allowance. I am very angry indeed, and I have
010166 been shamefully used."
010167 
010168 "I think that I heard a ring," said Holmes. "Yes, there are steps
010169 on the landing. If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view
010170 of the matter, Lord St. Simon, I have brought an advocate here
010171 who may be more successful." He opened the door and ushered in a
010172 lady and gentleman. "Lord St. Simon," said he "allow me to
010173 introduce you to Mr. and Mrs. Francis Hay Moulton. The lady, I
010174 think, you have already met."
010175 
010176 At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his
010177 seat and stood very erect, with his eyes cast down and his hand
010178 thrust into the breast of his frock-coat, a picture of offended
010179 dignity. The lady had taken a quick step forward and had held out
010180 her hand to him, but he still refused to raise his eyes. It was
010181 as well for his resolution, perhaps, for her pleading face was
010182 one which it was hard to resist.
010183 
010184 "You're angry, Robert," said she. "Well, I guess you have every
010185 cause to be."
010186 
010187 "Pray make no apology to me," said Lord St. Simon bitterly.
010188 
010189 "Oh, yes, I know that I have treated you real bad and that I
010190 should have spoken to you before I went; but I was kind of
010191 rattled, and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just
010192 didn't know what I was doing or saying. I only wonder I didn't
010193 fall down and do a faint right there before the altar."
010194 
010195 "Perhaps, Mrs. Moulton, you would like my friend and me to leave
010196 the room while you explain this matter?"
010197 
010198 "If I may give an opinion," remarked the strange gentleman,
010199 "we've had just a little too much secrecy over this business
010200 already. For my part, I should like all Europe and America to
010201 hear the rights of it." He was a small, wiry, sunburnt man,
010202 clean-shaven, with a sharp face and alert manner.
010203 
010204 "Then I'll tell our story right away," said the lady. "Frank here
010205 and I met in '84, in McQuire's camp, near the Rockies, where pa
010206 was working a claim. We were engaged to each other, Frank and I;
010207 but then one day father struck a rich pocket and made a pile,
010208 while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to
010209 nothing. The richer pa grew the poorer was Frank; so at last pa
010210 wouldn't hear of our engagement lasting any longer, and he took
010211 me away to 'Frisco. Frank wouldn't throw up his hand, though; so
010212 he followed me there, and he saw me without pa knowing anything
010213 about it. It would only have made him mad to know, so we just
010214 fixed it all up for ourselves. Frank said that he would go and
010215 make his pile, too, and never come back to claim me until he had
010216 as much as pa. So then I promised to wait for him to the end of
010217 time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived.
010218 'Why shouldn't we be married right away, then,' said he, 'and
010219 then I will feel sure of you; and I won't claim to be your
010220 husband until I come back?' Well, we talked it over, and he had
010221 fixed it all up so nicely, with a clergyman all ready in waiting,
010222 that we just did it right there; and then Frank went off to seek
010223 his fortune, and I went back to pa.
010224 
010225 "The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana, and then
010226 he went prospecting in Arizona, and then I heard of him from New
010227 Mexico. After that came a long newspaper story about how a
010228 miners' camp had been attacked by Apache Indians, and there was
010229 my Frank's name among the killed. I fainted dead away, and I was
010230 very sick for months after. Pa thought I had a decline and took
010231 me to half the doctors in 'Frisco. Not a word of news came for a
010232 year and more, so that I never doubted that Frank was really
010233 dead. Then Lord St. Simon came to 'Frisco, and we came to London,
010234 and a marriage was arranged, and pa was very pleased, but I felt
010235 all the time that no man on this earth would ever take the place
010236 in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank.
010237 
010238 "Still, if I had married Lord St. Simon, of course I'd have done
010239 my duty by him. We can't command our love, but we can our
010240 actions. I went to the altar with him with the intention to make
010241 him just as good a wife as it was in me to be. But you may
010242 imagine what I felt when, just as I came to the altar rails, I
010243 glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the
010244 first pew. I thought it was his ghost at first; but when I looked
010245 again there he was still, with a kind of question in his eyes, as
010246 if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him. I wonder I
010247 didn't drop. I know that everything was turning round, and the
010248 words of the clergyman were just like the buzz of a bee in my
010249 ear. I didn't know what to do. Should I stop the service and make
010250 a scene in the church? I glanced at him again, and he seemed to
010251 know what I was thinking, for he raised his finger to his lips to
010252 tell me to be still. Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper,
010253 and I knew that he was writing me a note. As I passed his pew on
010254 the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him, and he slipped the
010255 note into my hand when he returned me the flowers. It was only a
010256 line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so.
010257 Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now
010258 to him, and I determined to do just whatever he might direct.
010259 
010260 "When I got back I told my maid, who had known him in California,
010261 and had always been his friend. I ordered her to say nothing, but
010262 to get a few things packed and my ulster ready. I know I ought to
010263 have spoken to Lord St. Simon, but it was dreadful hard before
010264 his mother and all those great people. I just made up my mind to
010265 run away and explain afterwards. I hadn't been at the table ten
010266 minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the other side of
010267 the road. He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park.
010268 I slipped out, put on my things, and followed him. Some woman
010269 came talking something or other about Lord St. Simon to
010270 me--seemed to me from the little I heard as if he had a little
010271 secret of his own before marriage also--but I managed to get away
010272 from her and soon overtook Frank. We got into a cab together, and
010273 away we drove to some lodgings he had taken in Gordon Square, and
010274 that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting. Frank
010275 had been a prisoner among the Apaches, had escaped, came on to
010276 'Frisco, found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to
010277 England, followed me there, and had come upon me at last on the
010278 very morning of my second wedding."
010279 
010280 "I saw it in a paper," explained the American. "It gave the name
010281 and the church but not where the lady lived."
010282 
010283 "Then we had a talk as to what we should do, and Frank was all
010284 for openness, but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I
010285 should like to vanish away and never see any of them again--just
010286 sending a line to pa, perhaps, to show him that I was alive. It
010287 was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting
010288 round that breakfast-table and waiting for me to come back. So
010289 Frank took my wedding-clothes and things and made a bundle of
010290 them, so that I should not be traced, and dropped them away
010291 somewhere where no one could find them. It is likely that we
010292 should have gone on to Paris to-morrow, only that this good
010293 gentleman, Mr. Holmes, came round to us this evening, though how
010294 he found us is more than I can think, and he showed us very
010295 clearly and kindly that I was wrong and that Frank was right, and
010296 that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so
010297 secret. Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord
010298 St. Simon alone, and so we came right away round to his rooms at
010299 once. Now, Robert, you have heard it all, and I am very sorry if
010300 I have given you pain, and I hope that you do not think very
010301 meanly of me."
010302 
010303 Lord St. Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude, but
010304 had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this
010305 long narrative.
010306 
010307 "Excuse me," he said, "but it is not my custom to discuss my most
010308 intimate personal affairs in this public manner."
010309 
010310 "Then you won't forgive me? You won't shake hands before I go?"
010311 
010312 "Oh, certainly, if it would give you any pleasure." He put out
010313 his hand and coldly grasped that which she extended to him.
010314 
010315 "I had hoped," suggested Holmes, "that you would have joined us
010316 in a friendly supper."
010317 
010318 "I think that there you ask a little too much," responded his
010319 Lordship. "I may be forced to acquiesce in these recent
010320 developments, but I can hardly be expected to make merry over
010321 them. I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a
010322 very good-night." He included us all in a sweeping bow and
010323 stalked out of the room.
010324 
010325 "Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your
010326 company," said Sherlock Holmes. "It is always a joy to meet an
010327 American, Mr. Moulton, for I am one of those who believe that the
010328 folly of a monarch and the blundering of a minister in far-gone
010329 years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens
010330 of the same world-wide country under a flag which shall be a
010331 quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes."
010332 
010333 "The case has been an interesting one," remarked Holmes when our
010334 visitors had left us, "because it serves to show very clearly how
010335 simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight
010336 seems to be almost inexplicable. Nothing could be more natural
010337 than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady, and nothing
010338 stranger than the result when viewed, for instance, by Mr.
010339 Lestrade of Scotland Yard."
010340 
010341 "You were not yourself at fault at all, then?"
010342 
010343 "From the first, two facts were very obvious to me, the one that
010344 the lady had been quite willing to undergo the wedding ceremony,
010345 the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of
010346 returning home. Obviously something had occurred during the
010347 morning, then, to cause her to change her mind. What could that
010348 something be? She could not have spoken to anyone when she was
010349 out, for she had been in the company of the bridegroom. Had she
010350 seen someone, then? If she had, it must be someone from America
010351 because she had spent so short a time in this country that she
010352 could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence
010353 over her that the mere sight of him would induce her to change
010354 her plans so completely. You see we have already arrived, by a
010355 process of exclusion, at the idea that she might have seen an
010356 American. Then who could this American be, and why should he
010357 possess so much influence over her? It might be a lover; it might
010358 be a husband. Her young womanhood had, I knew, been spent in
010359 rough scenes and under strange conditions. So far I had got
010360 before I ever heard Lord St. Simon's narrative. When he told us
010361 of a man in a pew, of the change in the bride's manner, of so
010362 transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a
010363 bouquet, of her resort to her confidential maid, and of her very
010364 significant allusion to claim-jumping--which in miners' parlance
010365 means taking possession of that which another person has a prior
010366 claim to--the whole situation became absolutely clear. She had
010367 gone off with a man, and the man was either a lover or was a
010368 previous husband--the chances being in favour of the latter."
010369 
010370 "And how in the world did you find them?"
010371 
010372 "It might have been difficult, but friend Lestrade held
010373 information in his hands the value of which he did not himself
010374 know. The initials were, of course, of the highest importance,
010375 but more valuable still was it to know that within a week he had
010376 settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels."
010377 
010378 "How did you deduce the select?"
010379 
010380 "By the select prices. Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence
010381 for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive
010382 hotels. There are not many in London which charge at that rate.
010383 In the second one which I visited in Northumberland Avenue, I
010384 learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H. Moulton, an
010385 American gentleman, had left only the day before, and on looking
010386 over the entries against him, I came upon the very items which I
010387 had seen in the duplicate bill. His letters were to be forwarded
010388 to 226 Gordon Square; so thither I travelled, and being fortunate
010389 enough to find the loving couple at home, I ventured to give them
010390 some paternal advice and to point out to them that it would be
010391 better in every way that they should make their position a little
010392 clearer both to the general public and to Lord St. Simon in
010393 particular. I invited them to meet him here, and, as you see, I
010394 made him keep the appointment."
010395 
010396 "But with no very good result," I remarked. "His conduct was
010397 certainly not very gracious."
010398 
010399 "Ah, Watson," said Holmes, smiling, "perhaps you would not be
010400 very gracious either, if, after all the trouble of wooing and
010401 wedding, you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of
010402 fortune. I think that we may judge Lord St. Simon very mercifully
010403 and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in
010404 the same position. Draw your chair up and hand me my violin, for
010405 the only problem we have still to solve is how to while away
010406 these bleak autumnal evenings."
010407 
010408 
010409 
010410 XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
010411 
010412 "Holmes," said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking
010413 down the street, "here is a madman coming along. It seems rather
010414 sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone."
010415 
010416 My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands
010417 in the pockets of his dressing-gown, looking over my shoulder. It
010418 was a bright, crisp February morning, and the snow of the day
010419 before still lay deep upon the ground, shimmering brightly in the
010420 wintry sun. Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed
010421 into a brown crumbly band by the traffic, but at either side and
010422 on the heaped-up edges of the foot-paths it still lay as white as
010423 when it fell. The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped, but
010424 was still dangerously slippery, so that there were fewer
010425 passengers than usual. Indeed, from the direction of the
010426 Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman
010427 whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention.
010428 
010429 He was a man of about fifty, tall, portly, and imposing, with a
010430 massive, strongly marked face and a commanding figure. He was
010431 dressed in a sombre yet rich style, in black frock-coat, shining
010432 hat, neat brown gaiters, and well-cut pearl-grey trousers. Yet
010433 his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress
010434 and features, for he was running hard, with occasional little
010435 springs, such as a weary man gives who is little accustomed to
010436 set any tax upon his legs. As he ran he jerked his hands up and
010437 down, waggled his head, and writhed his face into the most
010438 extraordinary contortions.
010439 
010440 "What on earth can be the matter with him?" I asked. "He is
010441 looking up at the numbers of the houses."
010442 
010443 "I believe that he is coming here," said Holmes, rubbing his
010444 hands.
010445 
010446 "Here?"
010447 
010448 "Yes; I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally. I
010449 think that I recognise the symptoms. Ha! did I not tell you?" As
010450 he spoke, the man, puffing and blowing, rushed at our door and
010451 pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the
010452 clanging.
010453 
010454 A few moments later he was in our room, still puffing, still
010455 gesticulating, but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in
010456 his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and
010457 pity. For a while he could not get his words out, but swayed his
010458 body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the
010459 extreme limits of his reason. Then, suddenly springing to his
010460 feet, he beat his head against the wall with such force that we
010461 both rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room.
010462 Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easy-chair and, sitting
010463 beside him, patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy,
010464 soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ.
010465 
010466 "You have come to me to tell your story, have you not?" said he.
010467 "You are fatigued with your haste. Pray wait until you have
010468 recovered yourself, and then I shall be most happy to look into
010469 any little problem which you may submit to me."
010470 
010471 The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest, fighting
010472 against his emotion. Then he passed his handkerchief over his
010473 brow, set his lips tight, and turned his face towards us.
010474 
010475 "No doubt you think me mad?" said he.
010476 
010477 "I see that you have had some great trouble," responded Holmes.
010478 
010479 "God knows I have!--a trouble which is enough to unseat my
010480 reason, so sudden and so terrible is it. Public disgrace I might
010481 have faced, although I am a man whose character has never yet
010482 borne a stain. Private affliction also is the lot of every man;
010483 but the two coming together, and in so frightful a form, have
010484 been enough to shake my very soul. Besides, it is not I alone.
010485 The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found
010486 out of this horrible affair."
010487 
010488 "Pray compose yourself, sir," said Holmes, "and let me have a
010489 clear account of who you are and what it is that has befallen
010490 you."
010491 
010492 "My name," answered our visitor, "is probably familiar to your
010493 ears. I am Alexander Holder, of the banking firm of Holder &
010494 Stevenson, of Threadneedle Street."
010495 
010496 The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior
010497 partner in the second largest private banking concern in the City
010498 of London. What could have happened, then, to bring one of the
010499 foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass? We
010500 waited, all curiosity, until with another effort he braced
010501 himself to tell his story.
010502 
010503 "I feel that time is of value," said he; "that is why I hastened
010504 here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure
010505 your co-operation. I came to Baker Street by the Underground and
010506 hurried from there on foot, for the cabs go slowly through this
010507 snow. That is why I was so out of breath, for I am a man who
010508 takes very little exercise. I feel better now, and I will put the
010509 facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can.
010510 
010511 "It is, of course, well known to you that in a successful banking
010512 business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative
010513 investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection
010514 and the number of our depositors. One of our most lucrative means
010515 of laying out money is in the shape of loans, where the security
010516 is unimpeachable. We have done a good deal in this direction
010517 during the last few years, and there are many noble families to
010518 whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their
010519 pictures, libraries, or plate.
010520 
010521 "Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a
010522 card was brought in to me by one of the clerks. I started when I
010523 saw the name, for it was that of none other than--well, perhaps
010524 even to you I had better say no more than that it was a name
010525 which is a household word all over the earth--one of the highest,
010526 noblest, most exalted names in England. I was overwhelmed by the
010527 honour and attempted, when he entered, to say so, but he plunged
010528 at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry
010529 quickly through a disagreeable task.
010530 
010531 "'Mr. Holder,' said he, 'I have been informed that you are in the
010532 habit of advancing money.'
010533 
010534 "'The firm does so when the security is good.' I answered.
010535 
010536 "'It is absolutely essential to me,' said he, 'that I should have
010537 50,000 pounds at once. I could, of course, borrow so trifling a
010538 sum ten times over from my friends, but I much prefer to make it
010539 a matter of business and to carry out that business myself. In my
010540 position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place
010541 one's self under obligations.'
010542 
010543 "'For how long, may I ask, do you want this sum?' I asked.
010544 
010545 "'Next Monday I have a large sum due to me, and I shall then most
010546 certainly repay what you advance, with whatever interest you
010547 think it right to charge. But it is very essential to me that the
010548 money should be paid at once.'
010549 
010550 "'I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my
010551 own private purse,' said I, 'were it not that the strain would be
010552 rather more than it could bear. If, on the other hand, I am to do
010553 it in the name of the firm, then in justice to my partner I must
010554 insist that, even in your case, every businesslike precaution
010555 should be taken.'
010556 
010557 "'I should much prefer to have it so,' said he, raising up a
010558 square, black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair.
010559 'You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet?'
010560 
010561 "'One of the most precious public possessions of the empire,'
010562 said I.
010563 
010564 "'Precisely.' He opened the case, and there, imbedded in soft,
010565 flesh-coloured velvet, lay the magnificent piece of jewellery
010566 which he had named. 'There are thirty-nine enormous beryls,' said
010567 he, 'and the price of the gold chasing is incalculable. The
010568 lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the
010569 sum which I have asked. I am prepared to leave it with you as my
010570 security.'
010571 
010572 "I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some
010573 perplexity from it to my illustrious client.
010574 
010575 "'You doubt its value?' he asked.
010576 
010577 "'Not at all. I only doubt--'
010578 
010579 "'The propriety of my leaving it. You may set your mind at rest
010580 about that. I should not dream of doing so were it not absolutely
010581 certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it. It is a
010582 pure matter of form. Is the security sufficient?'
010583 
010584 "'Ample.'
010585 
010586 "'You understand, Mr. Holder, that I am giving you a strong proof
010587 of the confidence which I have in you, founded upon all that I
010588 have heard of you. I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to
010589 refrain from all gossip upon the matter but, above all, to
010590 preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I
010591 need not say that a great public scandal would be caused if any
010592 harm were to befall it. Any injury to it would be almost as
010593 serious as its complete loss, for there are no beryls in the
010594 world to match these, and it would be impossible to replace them.
010595 I leave it with you, however, with every confidence, and I shall
010596 call for it in person on Monday morning.'
010597 
010598 "Seeing that my client was anxious to leave, I said no more but,
010599 calling for my cashier, I ordered him to pay over fifty 1000
010600 pound notes. When I was alone once more, however, with the
010601 precious case lying upon the table in front of me, I could not
010602 but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility
010603 which it entailed upon me. There could be no doubt that, as it
010604 was a national possession, a horrible scandal would ensue if any
010605 misfortune should occur to it. I already regretted having ever
010606 consented to take charge of it. However, it was too late to alter
010607 the matter now, so I locked it up in my private safe and turned
010608 once more to my work.
010609 
010610 "When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave
010611 so precious a thing in the office behind me. Bankers' safes had
010612 been forced before now, and why should not mine be? If so, how
010613 terrible would be the position in which I should find myself! I
010614 determined, therefore, that for the next few days I would always
010615 carry the case backward and forward with me, so that it might
010616 never be really out of my reach. With this intention, I called a
010617 cab and drove out to my house at Streatham, carrying the jewel
010618 with me. I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs
010619 and locked it in the bureau of my dressing-room.
010620 
010621 "And now a word as to my household, Mr. Holmes, for I wish you to
010622 thoroughly understand the situation. My groom and my page sleep
010623 out of the house, and may be set aside altogether. I have three
010624 maid-servants who have been with me a number of years and whose
010625 absolute reliability is quite above suspicion. Another, Lucy
010626 Parr, the second waiting-maid, has only been in my service a few
010627 months. She came with an excellent character, however, and has
010628 always given me satisfaction. She is a very pretty girl and has
010629 attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place.
010630 That is the only drawback which we have found to her, but we
010631 believe her to be a thoroughly good girl in every way.
010632 
010633 "So much for the servants. My family itself is so small that it
010634 will not take me long to describe it. I am a widower and have an
010635 only son, Arthur. He has been a disappointment to me, Mr.
010636 Holmes--a grievous disappointment. I have no doubt that I am
010637 myself to blame. People tell me that I have spoiled him. Very
010638 likely I have. When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I
010639 had to love. I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a
010640 moment from his face. I have never denied him a wish. Perhaps it
010641 would have been better for both of us had I been sterner, but I
010642 meant it for the best.
010643 
010644 "It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my
010645 business, but he was not of a business turn. He was wild,
010646 wayward, and, to speak the truth, I could not trust him in the
010647 handling of large sums of money. When he was young he became a
010648 member of an aristocratic club, and there, having charming
010649 manners, he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long
010650 purses and expensive habits. He learned to play heavily at cards
010651 and to squander money on the turf, until he had again and again
010652 to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his
010653 allowance, that he might settle his debts of honour. He tried
010654 more than once to break away from the dangerous company which he
010655 was keeping, but each time the influence of his friend, Sir
010656 George Burnwell, was enough to draw him back again.
010657 
010658 "And, indeed, I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George
010659 Burnwell should gain an influence over him, for he has frequently
010660 brought him to my house, and I have found myself that I could
010661 hardly resist the fascination of his manner. He is older than
010662 Arthur, a man of the world to his finger-tips, one who had been
010663 everywhere, seen everything, a brilliant talker, and a man of
010664 great personal beauty. Yet when I think of him in cold blood, far
010665 away from the glamour of his presence, I am convinced from his
010666 cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that
010667 he is one who should be deeply distrusted. So I think, and so,
010668 too, thinks my little Mary, who has a woman's quick insight into
010669 character.
010670 
010671 "And now there is only she to be described. She is my niece; but
010672 when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the
010673 world I adopted her, and have looked upon her ever since as my
010674 daughter. She is a sunbeam in my house--sweet, loving, beautiful,
010675 a wonderful manager and housekeeper, yet as tender and quiet and
010676 gentle as a woman could be. She is my right hand. I do not know
010677 what I could do without her. In only one matter has she ever gone
010678 against my wishes. Twice my boy has asked her to marry him, for
010679 he loves her devotedly, but each time she has refused him. I
010680 think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it
010681 would have been she, and that his marriage might have changed his
010682 whole life; but now, alas! it is too late--forever too late!
010683 
010684 "Now, Mr. Holmes, you know the people who live under my roof, and
010685 I shall continue with my miserable story.
010686 
010687 "When we were taking coffee in the drawing-room that night after
010688 dinner, I told Arthur and Mary my experience, and of the precious
010689 treasure which we had under our roof, suppressing only the name
010690 of my client. Lucy Parr, who had brought in the coffee, had, I am
010691 sure, left the room; but I cannot swear that the door was closed.
010692 Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous
010693 coronet, but I thought it better not to disturb it.
010694 
010695 "'Where have you put it?' asked Arthur.
010696 
010697 "'In my own bureau.'
010698 
010699 "'Well, I hope to goodness the house won't be burgled during the
010700 night.' said he.
010701 
010702 "'It is locked up,' I answered.
010703 
010704 "'Oh, any old key will fit that bureau. When I was a youngster I
010705 have opened it myself with the key of the box-room cupboard.'
010706 
010707 "He often had a wild way of talking, so that I thought little of
010708 what he said. He followed me to my room, however, that night with
010709 a very grave face.
010710 
010711 "'Look here, dad,' said he with his eyes cast down, 'can you let
010712 me have 200 pounds?'
010713 
010714 "'No, I cannot!' I answered sharply. 'I have been far too
010715 generous with you in money matters.'
010716 
010717 "'You have been very kind,' said he, 'but I must have this money,
010718 or else I can never show my face inside the club again.'
010719 
010720 "'And a very good thing, too!' I cried.
010721 
010722 "'Yes, but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man,'
010723 said he. 'I could not bear the disgrace. I must raise the money
010724 in some way, and if you will not let me have it, then I must try
010725 other means.'
010726 
010727 "I was very angry, for this was the third demand during the
010728 month. 'You shall not have a farthing from me,' I cried, on which
010729 he bowed and left the room without another word.
010730 
010731 "When he was gone I unlocked my bureau, made sure that my
010732 treasure was safe, and locked it again. Then I started to go
010733 round the house to see that all was secure--a duty which I
010734 usually leave to Mary but which I thought it well to perform
010735 myself that night. As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself
010736 at the side window of the hall, which she closed and fastened as
010737 I approached.
010738 
010739 "'Tell me, dad,' said she, looking, I thought, a little
010740 disturbed, 'did you give Lucy, the maid, leave to go out
010741 to-night?'
010742 
010743 "'Certainly not.'
010744 
010745 "'She came in just now by the back door. I have no doubt that she
010746 has only been to the side gate to see someone, but I think that
010747 it is hardly safe and should be stopped.'
010748 
010749 "'You must speak to her in the morning, or I will if you prefer
010750 it. Are you sure that everything is fastened?'
010751 
010752 "'Quite sure, dad.'
010753 
010754 "'Then, good-night.' I kissed her and went up to my bedroom
010755 again, where I was soon asleep.
010756 
010757 "I am endeavouring to tell you everything, Mr. Holmes, which may
010758 have any bearing upon the case, but I beg that you will question
010759 me upon any point which I do not make clear."
010760 
010761 "On the contrary, your statement is singularly lucid."
010762 
010763 "I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be
010764 particularly so. I am not a very heavy sleeper, and the anxiety
010765 in my mind tended, no doubt, to make me even less so than usual.
010766 About two in the morning, then, I was awakened by some sound in
010767 the house. It had ceased ere I was wide awake, but it had left an
010768 impression behind it as though a window had gently closed
010769 somewhere. I lay listening with all my ears. Suddenly, to my
010770 horror, there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in
010771 the next room. I slipped out of bed, all palpitating with fear,
010772 and peeped round the corner of my dressing-room door.
010773 
010774 "'Arthur!' I screamed, 'you villain! you thief! How dare you
010775 touch that coronet?'
010776 
010777 "The gas was half up, as I had left it, and my unhappy boy,
010778 dressed only in his shirt and trousers, was standing beside the
010779 light, holding the coronet in his hands. He appeared to be
010780 wrenching at it, or bending it with all his strength. At my cry
010781 he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death. I
010782 snatched it up and examined it. One of the gold corners, with
010783 three of the beryls in it, was missing.
010784 
010785 "'You blackguard!' I shouted, beside myself with rage. 'You have
010786 destroyed it! You have dishonoured me forever! Where are the
010787 jewels which you have stolen?'
010788 
010789 "'Stolen!' he cried.
010790 
010791 "'Yes, thief!' I roared, shaking him by the shoulder.
010792 
010793 "'There are none missing. There cannot be any missing,' said he.
010794 
010795 "'There are three missing. And you know where they are. Must I
010796 call you a liar as well as a thief? Did I not see you trying to
010797 tear off another piece?'
010798 
010799 "'You have called me names enough,' said he, 'I will not stand it
010800 any longer. I shall not say another word about this business,
010801 since you have chosen to insult me. I will leave your house in
010802 the morning and make my own way in the world.'
010803 
010804 "'You shall leave it in the hands of the police!' I cried
010805 half-mad with grief and rage. 'I shall have this matter probed to
010806 the bottom.'
010807 
010808 "'You shall learn nothing from me,' said he with a passion such
010809 as I should not have thought was in his nature. 'If you choose to
010810 call the police, let the police find what they can.'
010811 
010812 "By this time the whole house was astir, for I had raised my
010813 voice in my anger. Mary was the first to rush into my room, and,
010814 at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur's face, she read the
010815 whole story and, with a scream, fell down senseless on the
010816 ground. I sent the house-maid for the police and put the
010817 investigation into their hands at once. When the inspector and a
010818 constable entered the house, Arthur, who had stood sullenly with
010819 his arms folded, asked me whether it was my intention to charge
010820 him with theft. I answered that it had ceased to be a private
010821 matter, but had become a public one, since the ruined coronet was
010822 national property. I was determined that the law should have its
010823 way in everything.
010824 
010825 "'At least,' said he, 'you will not have me arrested at once. It
010826 would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the
010827 house for five minutes.'
010828 
010829 "'That you may get away, or perhaps that you may conceal what you
010830 have stolen,' said I. And then, realising the dreadful position
010831 in which I was placed, I implored him to remember that not only
010832 my honour but that of one who was far greater than I was at
010833 stake; and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would
010834 convulse the nation. He might avert it all if he would but tell
010835 me what he had done with the three missing stones.
010836 
010837 "'You may as well face the matter,' said I; 'you have been caught
010838 in the act, and no confession could make your guilt more heinous.
010839 If you but make such reparation as is in your power, by telling
010840 us where the beryls are, all shall be forgiven and forgotten.'
010841 
010842 "'Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it,' he answered,
010843 turning away from me with a sneer. I saw that he was too hardened
010844 for any words of mine to influence him. There was but one way for
010845 it. I called in the inspector and gave him into custody. A search
010846 was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of
010847 every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed
010848 the gems; but no trace of them could be found, nor would the
010849 wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our
010850 threats. This morning he was removed to a cell, and I, after
010851 going through all the police formalities, have hurried round to
010852 you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter.
010853 The police have openly confessed that they can at present make
010854 nothing of it. You may go to any expense which you think
010855 necessary. I have already offered a reward of 1000 pounds. My
010856 God, what shall I do! I have lost my honour, my gems, and my son
010857 in one night. Oh, what shall I do!"
010858 
010859 He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to
010860 and fro, droning to himself like a child whose grief has got
010861 beyond words.
010862 
010863 Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes, with his brows
010864 knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire.
010865 
010866 "Do you receive much company?" he asked.
010867 
010868 "None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of
010869 Arthur's. Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately. No
010870 one else, I think."
010871 
010872 "Do you go out much in society?"
010873 
010874 "Arthur does. Mary and I stay at home. We neither of us care for
010875 it."
010876 
010877 "That is unusual in a young girl."
010878 
010879 "She is of a quiet nature. Besides, she is not so very young. She
010880 is four-and-twenty."
010881 
010882 "This matter, from what you say, seems to have been a shock to
010883 her also."
010884 
010885 "Terrible! She is even more affected than I."
010886 
010887 "You have neither of you any doubt as to your son's guilt?"
010888 
010889 "How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet
010890 in his hands."
010891 
010892 "I hardly consider that a conclusive proof. Was the remainder of
010893 the coronet at all injured?"
010894 
010895 "Yes, it was twisted."
010896 
010897 "Do you not think, then, that he might have been trying to
010898 straighten it?"
010899 
010900 "God bless you! You are doing what you can for him and for me.
010901 But it is too heavy a task. What was he doing there at all? If
010902 his purpose were innocent, why did he not say so?"
010903 
010904 "Precisely. And if it were guilty, why did he not invent a lie?
010905 His silence appears to me to cut both ways. There are several
010906 singular points about the case. What did the police think of the
010907 noise which awoke you from your sleep?"
010908 
010909 "They considered that it might be caused by Arthur's closing his
010910 bedroom door."
010911 
010912 "A likely story! As if a man bent on felony would slam his door
010913 so as to wake a household. What did they say, then, of the
010914 disappearance of these gems?"
010915 
010916 "They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture
010917 in the hope of finding them."
010918 
010919 "Have they thought of looking outside the house?"
010920 
010921 "Yes, they have shown extraordinary energy. The whole garden has
010922 already been minutely examined."
010923 
010924 "Now, my dear sir," said Holmes, "is it not obvious to you now
010925 that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you
010926 or the police were at first inclined to think? It appeared to you
010927 to be a simple case; to me it seems exceedingly complex. Consider
010928 what is involved by your theory. You suppose that your son came
010929 down from his bed, went, at great risk, to your dressing-room,
010930 opened your bureau, took out your coronet, broke off by main
010931 force a small portion of it, went off to some other place,
010932 concealed three gems out of the thirty-nine, with such skill that
010933 nobody can find them, and then returned with the other thirty-six
010934 into the room in which he exposed himself to the greatest danger
010935 of being discovered. I ask you now, is such a theory tenable?"
010936 
010937 "But what other is there?" cried the banker with a gesture of
010938 despair. "If his motives were innocent, why does he not explain
010939 them?"
010940 
010941 "It is our task to find that out," replied Holmes; "so now, if
010942 you please, Mr. Holder, we will set off for Streatham together,
010943 and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into
010944 details."
010945 
010946 My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition,
010947 which I was eager enough to do, for my curiosity and sympathy
010948 were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened. I
010949 confess that the guilt of the banker's son appeared to me to be
010950 as obvious as it did to his unhappy father, but still I had such
010951 faith in Holmes' judgment that I felt that there must be some
010952 grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted
010953 explanation. He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the
010954 southern suburb, but sat with his chin upon his breast and his
010955 hat drawn over his eyes, sunk in the deepest thought. Our client
010956 appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope
010957 which had been presented to him, and he even broke into a
010958 desultory chat with me over his business affairs. A short railway
010959 journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank, the modest
010960 residence of the great financier.
010961 
010962 Fairbank was a good-sized square house of white stone, standing
010963 back a little from the road. A double carriage-sweep, with a
010964 snow-clad lawn, stretched down in front to two large iron gates
010965 which closed the entrance. On the right side was a small wooden
010966 thicket, which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges
010967 stretching from the road to the kitchen door, and forming the
010968 tradesmen's entrance. On the left ran a lane which led to the
010969 stables, and was not itself within the grounds at all, being a
010970 public, though little used, thoroughfare. Holmes left us standing
010971 at the door and walked slowly all round the house, across the
010972 front, down the tradesmen's path, and so round by the garden
010973 behind into the stable lane. So long was he that Mr. Holder and I
010974 went into the dining-room and waited by the fire until he should
010975 return. We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and
010976 a young lady came in. She was rather above the middle height,
010977 slim, with dark hair and eyes, which seemed the darker against
010978 the absolute pallor of her skin. I do not think that I have ever
010979 seen such deadly paleness in a woman's face. Her lips, too, were
010980 bloodless, but her eyes were flushed with crying. As she swept
010981 silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of
010982 grief than the banker had done in the morning, and it was the
010983 more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong
010984 character, with immense capacity for self-restraint. Disregarding
010985 my presence, she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand
010986 over his head with a sweet womanly caress.
010987 
010988 "You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated, have you
010989 not, dad?" she asked.
010990 
010991 "No, no, my girl, the matter must be probed to the bottom."
010992 
010993 "But I am so sure that he is innocent. You know what woman's
010994 instincts are. I know that he has done no harm and that you will
010995 be sorry for having acted so harshly."
010996 
010997 "Why is he silent, then, if he is innocent?"
010998 
010999 "Who knows? Perhaps because he was so angry that you should
011000 suspect him."
011001 
011002 "How could I help suspecting him, when I actually saw him with
011003 the coronet in his hand?"
011004 
011005 "Oh, but he had only picked it up to look at it. Oh, do, do take
011006 my word for it that he is innocent. Let the matter drop and say
011007 no more. It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in
011008 prison!"
011009 
011010 "I shall never let it drop until the gems are found--never, Mary!
011011 Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences
011012 to me. Far from hushing the thing up, I have brought a gentleman
011013 down from London to inquire more deeply into it."
011014 
011015 "This gentleman?" she asked, facing round to me.
011016 
011017 "No, his friend. He wished us to leave him alone. He is round in
011018 the stable lane now."
011019 
011020 "The stable lane?" She raised her dark eyebrows. "What can he
011021 hope to find there? Ah! this, I suppose, is he. I trust, sir,
011022 that you will succeed in proving, what I feel sure is the truth,
011023 that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime."
011024 
011025 "I fully share your opinion, and I trust, with you, that we may
011026 prove it," returned Holmes, going back to the mat to knock the
011027 snow from his shoes. "I believe I have the honour of addressing
011028 Miss Mary Holder. Might I ask you a question or two?"
011029 
011030 "Pray do, sir, if it may help to clear this horrible affair up."
011031 
011032 "You heard nothing yourself last night?"
011033 
011034 "Nothing, until my uncle here began to speak loudly. I heard
011035 that, and I came down."
011036 
011037 "You shut up the windows and doors the night before. Did you
011038 fasten all the windows?"
011039 
011040 "Yes."
011041 
011042 "Were they all fastened this morning?"
011043 
011044 "Yes."
011045 
011046 "You have a maid who has a sweetheart? I think that you remarked
011047 to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him?"
011048 
011049 "Yes, and she was the girl who waited in the drawing-room, and
011050 who may have heard uncle's remarks about the coronet."
011051 
011052 "I see. You infer that she may have gone out to tell her
011053 sweetheart, and that the two may have planned the robbery."
011054 
011055 "But what is the good of all these vague theories," cried the
011056 banker impatiently, "when I have told you that I saw Arthur with
011057 the coronet in his hands?"
011058 
011059 "Wait a little, Mr. Holder. We must come back to that. About this
011060 girl, Miss Holder. You saw her return by the kitchen door, I
011061 presume?"
011062 
011063 "Yes; when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I
011064 met her slipping in. I saw the man, too, in the gloom."
011065 
011066 "Do you know him?"
011067 
011068 "Oh, yes! he is the green-grocer who brings our vegetables round.
011069 His name is Francis Prosper."
011070 
011071 "He stood," said Holmes, "to the left of the door--that is to
011072 say, farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door?"
011073 
011074 "Yes, he did."
011075 
011076 "And he is a man with a wooden leg?"
011077 
011078 Something like fear sprang up in the young lady's expressive
011079 black eyes. "Why, you are like a magician," said she. "How do you
011080 know that?" She smiled, but there was no answering smile in
011081 Holmes' thin, eager face.
011082 
011083 "I should be very glad now to go upstairs," said he. "I shall
011084 probably wish to go over the outside of the house again. Perhaps
011085 I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up."
011086 
011087 He walked swiftly round from one to the other, pausing only at
011088 the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane.
011089 This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill
011090 with his powerful magnifying lens. "Now we shall go upstairs,"
011091 said he at last.
011092 
011093 The banker's dressing-room was a plainly furnished little
011094 chamber, with a grey carpet, a large bureau, and a long mirror.
011095 Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock.
011096 
011097 "Which key was used to open it?" he asked.
011098 
011099 "That which my son himself indicated--that of the cupboard of the
011100 lumber-room."
011101 
011102 "Have you it here?"
011103 
011104 "That is it on the dressing-table."
011105 
011106 Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau.
011107 
011108 "It is a noiseless lock," said he. "It is no wonder that it did
011109 not wake you. This case, I presume, contains the coronet. We must
011110 have a look at it." He opened the case, and taking out the diadem
011111 he laid it upon the table. It was a magnificent specimen of the
011112 jeweller's art, and the thirty-six stones were the finest that I
011113 have ever seen. At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge,
011114 where a corner holding three gems had been torn away.
011115 
011116 "Now, Mr. Holder," said Holmes, "here is the corner which
011117 corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost. Might I
011118 beg that you will break it off."
011119 
011120 The banker recoiled in horror. "I should not dream of trying,"
011121 said he.
011122 
011123 "Then I will." Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it, but
011124 without result. "I feel it give a little," said he; "but, though
011125 I am exceptionally strong in the fingers, it would take me all my
011126 time to break it. An ordinary man could not do it. Now, what do
011127 you think would happen if I did break it, Mr. Holder? There would
011128 be a noise like a pistol shot. Do you tell me that all this
011129 happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard
011130 nothing of it?"
011131 
011132 "I do not know what to think. It is all dark to me."
011133 
011134 "But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go. What do you think,
011135 Miss Holder?"
011136 
011137 "I confess that I still share my uncle's perplexity."
011138 
011139 "Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him?"
011140 
011141 "He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt."
011142 
011143 "Thank you. We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary
011144 luck during this inquiry, and it will be entirely our own fault
011145 if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up. With your
011146 permission, Mr. Holder, I shall now continue my investigations
011147 outside."
011148 
011149 He went alone, at his own request, for he explained that any
011150 unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult. For an
011151 hour or more he was at work, returning at last with his feet
011152 heavy with snow and his features as inscrutable as ever.
011153 
011154 "I think that I have seen now all that there is to see, Mr.
011155 Holder," said he; "I can serve you best by returning to my
011156 rooms."
011157 
011158 "But the gems, Mr. Holmes. Where are they?"
011159 
011160 "I cannot tell."
011161 
011162 The banker wrung his hands. "I shall never see them again!" he
011163 cried. "And my son? You give me hopes?"
011164 
011165 "My opinion is in no way altered."
011166 
011167 "Then, for God's sake, what was this dark business which was
011168 acted in my house last night?"
011169 
011170 "If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to-morrow
011171 morning between nine and ten I shall be happy to do what I can to
011172 make it clearer. I understand that you give me carte blanche to
011173 act for you, provided only that I get back the gems, and that you
011174 place no limit on the sum I may draw."
011175 
011176 "I would give my fortune to have them back."
011177 
011178 "Very good. I shall look into the matter between this and then.
011179 Good-bye; it is just possible that I may have to come over here
011180 again before evening."
011181 
011182 It was obvious to me that my companion's mind was now made up
011183 about the case, although what his conclusions were was more than
011184 I could even dimly imagine. Several times during our homeward
011185 journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point, but he always
011186 glided away to some other topic, until at last I gave it over in
011187 despair. It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our
011188 rooms once more. He hurried to his chamber and was down again in
011189 a few minutes dressed as a common loafer. With his collar turned
011190 up, his shiny, seedy coat, his red cravat, and his worn boots, he
011191 was a perfect sample of the class.
011192 
011193 "I think that this should do," said he, glancing into the glass
011194 above the fireplace. "I only wish that you could come with me,
011195 Watson, but I fear that it won't do. I may be on the trail in
011196 this matter, or I may be following a will-o'-the-wisp, but I
011197 shall soon know which it is. I hope that I may be back in a few
011198 hours." He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard,
011199 sandwiched it between two rounds of bread, and thrusting this
011200 rude meal into his pocket he started off upon his expedition.
011201 
011202 I had just finished my tea when he returned, evidently in
011203 excellent spirits, swinging an old elastic-sided boot in his
011204 hand. He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a
011205 cup of tea.
011206 
011207 "I only looked in as I passed," said he. "I am going right on."
011208 
011209 "Where to?"
011210 
011211 "Oh, to the other side of the West End. It may be some time
011212 before I get back. Don't wait up for me in case I should be
011213 late."
011214 
011215 "How are you getting on?"
011216 
011217 "Oh, so so. Nothing to complain of. I have been out to Streatham
011218 since I saw you last, but I did not call at the house. It is a
011219 very sweet little problem, and I would not have missed it for a
011220 good deal. However, I must not sit gossiping here, but must get
011221 these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly
011222 respectable self."
011223 
011224 I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for
011225 satisfaction than his words alone would imply. His eyes twinkled,
011226 and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks. He
011227 hastened upstairs, and a few minutes later I heard the slam of
011228 the hall door, which told me that he was off once more upon his
011229 congenial hunt.
011230 
011231 I waited until midnight, but there was no sign of his return, so
011232 I retired to my room. It was no uncommon thing for him to be away
011233 for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent, so that
011234 his lateness caused me no surprise. I do not know at what hour he
011235 came in, but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there
011236 he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the
011237 other, as fresh and trim as possible.
011238 
011239 "You will excuse my beginning without you, Watson," said he, "but
011240 you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this
011241 morning."
011242 
011243 "Why, it is after nine now," I answered. "I should not be
011244 surprised if that were he. I thought I heard a ring."
011245 
011246 It was, indeed, our friend the financier. I was shocked by the
011247 change which had come over him, for his face which was naturally
011248 of a broad and massive mould, was now pinched and fallen in,
011249 while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter. He entered
011250 with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than
011251 his violence of the morning before, and he dropped heavily into
011252 the armchair which I pushed forward for him.
011253 
011254 "I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried," said
011255 he. "Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man, without
011256 a care in the world. Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured
011257 age. One sorrow comes close upon the heels of another. My niece,
011258 Mary, has deserted me."
011259 
011260 "Deserted you?"
011261 
011262 "Yes. Her bed this morning had not been slept in, her room was
011263 empty, and a note for me lay upon the hall table. I had said to
011264 her last night, in sorrow and not in anger, that if she had
011265 married my boy all might have been well with him. Perhaps it was
011266 thoughtless of me to say so. It is to that remark that she refers
011267 in this note:
011268 
011269 "'MY DEAREST UNCLE:--I feel that I have brought trouble upon you,
011270 and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune
011271 might never have occurred. I cannot, with this thought in my
011272 mind, ever again be happy under your roof, and I feel that I must
011273 leave you forever. Do not worry about my future, for that is
011274 provided for; and, above all, do not search for me, for it will
011275 be fruitless labour and an ill-service to me. In life or in
011276 death, I am ever your loving,--MARY.'
011277 
011278 "What could she mean by that note, Mr. Holmes? Do you think it
011279 points to suicide?"
011280 
011281 "No, no, nothing of the kind. It is perhaps the best possible
011282 solution. I trust, Mr. Holder, that you are nearing the end of
011283 your troubles."
011284 
011285 "Ha! You say so! You have heard something, Mr. Holmes; you have
011286 learned something! Where are the gems?"
011287 
011288 "You would not think 1000 pounds apiece an excessive sum for
011289 them?"
011290 
011291 "I would pay ten."
011292 
011293 "That would be unnecessary. Three thousand will cover the matter.
011294 And there is a little reward, I fancy. Have you your check-book?
011295 Here is a pen. Better make it out for 4000 pounds."
011296 
011297 With a dazed face the banker made out the required check. Holmes
011298 walked over to his desk, took out a little triangular piece of
011299 gold with three gems in it, and threw it down upon the table.
011300 
011301 With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up.
011302 
011303 "You have it!" he gasped. "I am saved! I am saved!"
011304 
011305 The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been, and
011306 he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom.
011307 
011308 "There is one other thing you owe, Mr. Holder," said Sherlock
011309 Holmes rather sternly.
011310 
011311 "Owe!" He caught up a pen. "Name the sum, and I will pay it."
011312 
011313 "No, the debt is not to me. You owe a very humble apology to that
011314 noble lad, your son, who has carried himself in this matter as I
011315 should be proud to see my own son do, should I ever chance to
011316 have one."
011317 
011318 "Then it was not Arthur who took them?"
011319 
011320 "I told you yesterday, and I repeat to-day, that it was not."
011321 
011322 "You are sure of it! Then let us hurry to him at once to let him
011323 know that the truth is known."
011324 
011325 "He knows it already. When I had cleared it all up I had an
011326 interview with him, and finding that he would not tell me the
011327 story, I told it to him, on which he had to confess that I was
011328 right and to add the very few details which were not yet quite
011329 clear to me. Your news of this morning, however, may open his
011330 lips."
011331 
011332 "For heaven's sake, tell me, then, what is this extraordinary
011333 mystery!"
011334 
011335 "I will do so, and I will show you the steps by which I reached
011336 it. And let me say to you, first, that which it is hardest for me
011337 to say and for you to hear: there has been an understanding
011338 between Sir George Burnwell and your niece Mary. They have now
011339 fled together."
011340 
011341 "My Mary? Impossible!"
011342 
011343 "It is unfortunately more than possible; it is certain. Neither
011344 you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you
011345 admitted him into your family circle. He is one of the most
011346 dangerous men in England--a ruined gambler, an absolutely
011347 desperate villain, a man without heart or conscience. Your niece
011348 knew nothing of such men. When he breathed his vows to her, as he
011349 had done to a hundred before her, she flattered herself that she
011350 alone had touched his heart. The devil knows best what he said,
011351 but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing
011352 him nearly every evening."
011353 
011354 "I cannot, and I will not, believe it!" cried the banker with an
011355 ashen face.
011356 
011357 "I will tell you, then, what occurred in your house last night.
011358 Your niece, when you had, as she thought, gone to your room,
011359 slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which
011360 leads into the stable lane. His footmarks had pressed right
011361 through the snow, so long had he stood there. She told him of the
011362 coronet. His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news, and he
011363 bent her to his will. I have no doubt that she loved you, but
011364 there are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all
011365 other loves, and I think that she must have been one. She had
011366 hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming
011367 downstairs, on which she closed the window rapidly and told you
011368 about one of the servants' escapade with her wooden-legged lover,
011369 which was all perfectly true.
011370 
011371 "Your boy, Arthur, went to bed after his interview with you but
011372 he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts.
011373 In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door,
011374 so he rose and, looking out, was surprised to see his cousin
011375 walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared
011376 into your dressing-room. Petrified with astonishment, the lad
011377 slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see what
011378 would come of this strange affair. Presently she emerged from the
011379 room again, and in the light of the passage-lamp your son saw
011380 that she carried the precious coronet in her hands. She passed
011381 down the stairs, and he, thrilling with horror, ran along and
011382 slipped behind the curtain near your door, whence he could see
011383 what passed in the hall beneath. He saw her stealthily open the
011384 window, hand out the coronet to someone in the gloom, and then
011385 closing it once more hurry back to her room, passing quite close
011386 to where he stood hid behind the curtain.
011387 
011388 "As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action
011389 without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved. But the
011390 instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune
011391 this would be for you, and how all-important it was to set it
011392 right. He rushed down, just as he was, in his bare feet, opened
011393 the window, sprang out into the snow, and ran down the lane,
011394 where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight. Sir George
011395 Burnwell tried to get away, but Arthur caught him, and there was
011396 a struggle between them, your lad tugging at one side of the
011397 coronet, and his opponent at the other. In the scuffle, your son
011398 struck Sir George and cut him over the eye. Then something
011399 suddenly snapped, and your son, finding that he had the coronet
011400 in his hands, rushed back, closed the window, ascended to your
011401 room, and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in
011402 the struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you
011403 appeared upon the scene."
011404 
011405 "Is it possible?" gasped the banker.
011406 
011407 "You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when
011408 he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks. He could not
011409 explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who
011410 certainly deserved little enough consideration at his hands. He
011411 took the more chivalrous view, however, and preserved her
011412 secret."
011413 
011414 "And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the
011415 coronet," cried Mr. Holder. "Oh, my God! what a blind fool I have
011416 been! And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes!
011417 The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the
011418 scene of the struggle. How cruelly I have misjudged him!"
011419 
011420 "When I arrived at the house," continued Holmes, "I at once went
011421 very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in
011422 the snow which might help me. I knew that none had fallen since
011423 the evening before, and also that there had been a strong frost
011424 to preserve impressions. I passed along the tradesmen's path, but
011425 found it all trampled down and indistinguishable. Just beyond it,
011426 however, at the far side of the kitchen door, a woman had stood
011427 and talked with a man, whose round impressions on one side showed
011428 that he had a wooden leg. I could even tell that they had been
011429 disturbed, for the woman had run back swiftly to the door, as was
011430 shown by the deep toe and light heel marks, while Wooden-leg had
011431 waited a little, and then had gone away. I thought at the time
011432 that this might be the maid and her sweetheart, of whom you had
011433 already spoken to me, and inquiry showed it was so. I passed
011434 round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks,
011435 which I took to be the police; but when I got into the stable
011436 lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in
011437 front of me.
011438 
011439 "There was a double line of tracks of a booted man, and a second
011440 double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked
011441 feet. I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the
011442 latter was your son. The first had walked both ways, but the
011443 other had run swiftly, and as his tread was marked in places over
011444 the depression of the boot, it was obvious that he had passed
011445 after the other. I followed them up and found they led to the
011446 hall window, where Boots had worn all the snow away while
011447 waiting. Then I walked to the other end, which was a hundred
011448 yards or more down the lane. I saw where Boots had faced round,
011449 where the snow was cut up as though there had been a struggle,
011450 and, finally, where a few drops of blood had fallen, to show me
011451 that I was not mistaken. Boots had then run down the lane, and
011452 another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who had been
011453 hurt. When he came to the highroad at the other end, I found that
011454 the pavement had been cleared, so there was an end to that clue.
011455 
011456 "On entering the house, however, I examined, as you remember, the
011457 sill and framework of the hall window with my lens, and I could
011458 at once see that someone had passed out. I could distinguish the
011459 outline of an instep where the wet foot had been placed in coming
011460 in. I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what
011461 had occurred. A man had waited outside the window; someone had
011462 brought the gems; the deed had been overseen by your son; he had
011463 pursued the thief; had struggled with him; they had each tugged
011464 at the coronet, their united strength causing injuries which
011465 neither alone could have effected. He had returned with the
011466 prize, but had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent. So
011467 far I was clear. The question now was, who was the man and who
011468 was it brought him the coronet?
011469 
011470 "It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the
011471 impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the
011472 truth. Now, I knew that it was not you who had brought it down,
011473 so there only remained your niece and the maids. But if it were
011474 the maids, why should your son allow himself to be accused in
011475 their place? There could be no possible reason. As he loved his
011476 cousin, however, there was an excellent explanation why he should
011477 retain her secret--the more so as the secret was a disgraceful
011478 one. When I remembered that you had seen her at that window, and
011479 how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again, my conjecture
011480 became a certainty.
011481 
011482 "And who could it be who was her confederate? A lover evidently,
011483 for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must
011484 feel to you? I knew that you went out little, and that your
011485 circle of friends was a very limited one. But among them was Sir
011486 George Burnwell. I had heard of him before as being a man of evil
011487 reputation among women. It must have been he who wore those boots
011488 and retained the missing gems. Even though he knew that Arthur
011489 had discovered him, he might still flatter himself that he was
011490 safe, for the lad could not say a word without compromising his
011491 own family.
011492 
011493 "Well, your own good sense will suggest what measures I took
011494 next. I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George's house,
011495 managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet, learned that
011496 his master had cut his head the night before, and, finally, at
011497 the expense of six shillings, made all sure by buying a pair of
011498 his cast-off shoes. With these I journeyed down to Streatham and
011499 saw that they exactly fitted the tracks."
011500 
011501 "I saw an ill-dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening,"
011502 said Mr. Holder.
011503 
011504 "Precisely. It was I. I found that I had my man, so I came home
011505 and changed my clothes. It was a delicate part which I had to
011506 play then, for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert
011507 scandal, and I knew that so astute a villain would see that our
011508 hands were tied in the matter. I went and saw him. At first, of
011509 course, he denied everything. But when I gave him every
011510 particular that had occurred, he tried to bluster and took down a
011511 life-preserver from the wall. I knew my man, however, and I
011512 clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike. Then he
011513 became a little more reasonable. I told him that we would give
011514 him a price for the stones he held--1000 pounds apiece. That
011515 brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown. 'Why,
011516 dash it all!' said he, 'I've let them go at six hundred for the
011517 three!' I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had
011518 them, on promising him that there would be no prosecution. Off I
011519 set to him, and after much chaffering I got our stones at 1000
011520 pounds apiece. Then I looked in upon your son, told him that all
011521 was right, and eventually got to my bed about two o'clock, after
011522 what I may call a really hard day's work."
011523 
011524 "A day which has saved England from a great public scandal," said
011525 the banker, rising. "Sir, I cannot find words to thank you, but
011526 you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done. Your
011527 skill has indeed exceeded all that I have heard of it. And now I
011528 must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I
011529 have done him. As to what you tell me of poor Mary, it goes to my
011530 very heart. Not even your skill can inform me where she is now."
011531 
011532 "I think that we may safely say," returned Holmes, "that she is
011533 wherever Sir George Burnwell is. It is equally certain, too, that
011534 whatever her sins are, they will soon receive a more than
011535 sufficient punishment."
011536 
011537 
011538 
011539 XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
011540 
011541 "To the man who loves art for its own sake," remarked Sherlock
011542 Holmes, tossing aside the advertisement sheet of the Daily
011543 Telegraph, "it is frequently in its least important and lowliest
011544 manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived. It is
011545 pleasant to me to observe, Watson, that you have so far grasped
011546 this truth that in these little records of our cases which you
011547 have been good enough to draw up, and, I am bound to say,
011548 occasionally to embellish, you have given prominence not so much
011549 to the many causes clbres and sensational trials in which I
011550 have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been
011551 trivial in themselves, but which have given room for those
011552 faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made
011553 my special province."
011554 
011555 "And yet," said I, smiling, "I cannot quite hold myself absolved
011556 from the charge of sensationalism which has been urged against my
011557 records."
011558 
011559 "You have erred, perhaps," he observed, taking up a glowing
011560 cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the long cherry-wood
011561 pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a
011562 disputatious rather than a meditative mood--"you have erred
011563 perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your
011564 statements instead of confining yourself to the task of placing
011565 upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is
011566 really the only notable feature about the thing."
011567 
011568 "It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter,"
011569 I remarked with some coldness, for I was repelled by the egotism
011570 which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my
011571 friend's singular character.
011572 
011573 "No, it is not selfishness or conceit," said he, answering, as
011574 was his wont, my thoughts rather than my words. "If I claim full
011575 justice for my art, it is because it is an impersonal thing--a
011576 thing beyond myself. Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it
011577 is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should
011578 dwell. You have degraded what should have been a course of
011579 lectures into a series of tales."
011580 
011581 It was a cold morning of the early spring, and we sat after
011582 breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old room at
011583 Baker Street. A thick fog rolled down between the lines of
011584 dun-coloured houses, and the opposing windows loomed like dark,
011585 shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths. Our gas was lit
011586 and shone on the white cloth and glimmer of china and metal, for
011587 the table had not been cleared yet. Sherlock Holmes had been
011588 silent all the morning, dipping continuously into the
011589 advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at last,
011590 having apparently given up his search, he had emerged in no very
011591 sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings.
011592 
011593 "At the same time," he remarked after a pause, during which he
011594 had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire,
011595 "you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism, for out of
011596 these cases which you have been so kind as to interest yourself
011597 in, a fair proportion do not treat of crime, in its legal sense,
011598 at all. The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King
011599 of Bohemia, the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland, the
011600 problem connected with the man with the twisted lip, and the
011601 incident of the noble bachelor, were all matters which are
011602 outside the pale of the law. But in avoiding the sensational, I
011603 fear that you may have bordered on the trivial."
011604 
011605 "The end may have been so," I answered, "but the methods I hold
011606 to have been novel and of interest."
011607 
011608 "Pshaw, my dear fellow, what do the public, the great unobservant
011609 public, who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a
011610 compositor by his left thumb, care about the finer shades of
011611 analysis and deduction! But, indeed, if you are trivial, I cannot
011612 blame you, for the days of the great cases are past. Man, or at
011613 least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As
011614 to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an
011615 agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to
011616 young ladies from boarding-schools. I think that I have touched
011617 bottom at last, however. This note I had this morning marks my
011618 zero-point, I fancy. Read it!" He tossed a crumpled letter across
011619 to me.
011620 
011621 It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening, and
011622 ran thus:
011623 
011624 "DEAR MR. HOLMES:--I am very anxious to consult you as to whether
011625 I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered
011626 to me as governess. I shall call at half-past ten to-morrow if I
011627 do not inconvenience you. Yours faithfully,
011628                                                "VIOLET HUNTER."
011629 
011630 "Do you know the young lady?" I asked.
011631 
011632 "Not I."
011633 
011634 "It is half-past ten now."
011635 
011636 "Yes, and I have no doubt that is her ring."
011637 
011638 "It may turn out to be of more interest than you think. You
011639 remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle, which appeared to
011640 be a mere whim at first, developed into a serious investigation.
011641 It may be so in this case, also."
011642 
011643 "Well, let us hope so. But our doubts will very soon be solved,
011644 for here, unless I am much mistaken, is the person in question."
011645 
011646 As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room.
011647 She was plainly but neatly dressed, with a bright, quick face,
011648 freckled like a plover's egg, and with the brisk manner of a
011649 woman who has had her own way to make in the world.
011650 
011651 "You will excuse my troubling you, I am sure," said she, as my
011652 companion rose to greet her, "but I have had a very strange
011653 experience, and as I have no parents or relations of any sort
011654 from whom I could ask advice, I thought that perhaps you would be
011655 kind enough to tell me what I should do."
011656 
011657 "Pray take a seat, Miss Hunter. I shall be happy to do anything
011658 that I can to serve you."
011659 
011660 I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner
011661 and speech of his new client. He looked her over in his searching
011662 fashion, and then composed himself, with his lids drooping and
011663 his finger-tips together, to listen to her story.
011664 
011665 "I have been a governess for five years," said she, "in the
011666 family of Colonel Spence Munro, but two months ago the colonel
011667 received an appointment at Halifax, in Nova Scotia, and took his
011668 children over to America with him, so that I found myself without
011669 a situation. I advertised, and I answered advertisements, but
011670 without success. At last the little money which I had saved began
011671 to run short, and I was at my wit's end as to what I should do.
011672 
011673 "There is a well-known agency for governesses in the West End
011674 called Westaway's, and there I used to call about once a week in
011675 order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me.
011676 Westaway was the name of the founder of the business, but it is
011677 really managed by Miss Stoper. She sits in her own little office,
011678 and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom,
011679 and are then shown in one by one, when she consults her ledgers
011680 and sees whether she has anything which would suit them.
011681 
011682 "Well, when I called last week I was shown into the little office
011683 as usual, but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone. A
011684 prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy
011685 chin which rolled down in fold upon fold over his throat sat at
011686 her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose, looking very
011687 earnestly at the ladies who entered. As I came in he gave quite a
011688 jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper.
011689 
011690 "'That will do,' said he; 'I could not ask for anything better.
011691 Capital! capital!' He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his
011692 hands together in the most genial fashion. He was such a
011693 comfortable-looking man that it was quite a pleasure to look at
011694 him.
011695 
011696 "'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.
011697 
011698 "'Yes, sir.'
011699 
011700 "'As governess?'
011701 
011702 "'Yes, sir.'
011703 
011704 "'And what salary do you ask?'
011705 
011706 "'I had 4 pounds a month in my last place with Colonel Spence
011707 Munro.'
011708 
011709 "'Oh, tut, tut! sweating--rank sweating!' he cried, throwing his
011710 fat hands out into the air like a man who is in a boiling
011711 passion. 'How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with
011712 such attractions and accomplishments?'
011713 
011714 "'My accomplishments, sir, may be less than you imagine,' said I.
011715 'A little French, a little German, music, and drawing--'
011716 
011717 "'Tut, tut!' he cried. 'This is all quite beside the question.
011718 The point is, have you or have you not the bearing and deportment
011719 of a lady? There it is in a nutshell. If you have not, you are
011720 not fitted for the rearing of a child who may some day play a
011721 considerable part in the history of the country. But if you have
011722 why, then, how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to
011723 accept anything under the three figures? Your salary with me,
011724 madam, would commence at 100 pounds a year.'
011725 
011726 "You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was,
011727 such an offer seemed almost too good to be true. The gentleman,
011728 however, seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face,
011729 opened a pocket-book and took out a note.
011730 
011731 "'It is also my custom,' said he, smiling in the most pleasant
011732 fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid
011733 the white creases of his face, 'to advance to my young ladies
011734 half their salary beforehand, so that they may meet any little
011735 expenses of their journey and their wardrobe.'
011736 
011737 "It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so
011738 thoughtful a man. As I was already in debt to my tradesmen, the
011739 advance was a great convenience, and yet there was something
011740 unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know
011741 a little more before I quite committed myself.
011742 
011743 "'May I ask where you live, sir?' said I.
011744 
011745 "'Hampshire. Charming rural place. The Copper Beeches, five miles
011746 on the far side of Winchester. It is the most lovely country, my
011747 dear young lady, and the dearest old country-house.'
011748 
011749 "'And my duties, sir? I should be glad to know what they would
011750 be.'
011751 
011752 "'One child--one dear little romper just six years old. Oh, if
011753 you could see him killing cockroaches with a slipper! Smack!
011754 smack! smack! Three gone before you could wink!' He leaned back
011755 in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again.
011756 
011757 "I was a little startled at the nature of the child's amusement,
011758 but the father's laughter made me think that perhaps he was
011759 joking.
011760 
011761 "'My sole duties, then,' I asked, 'are to take charge of a single
011762 child?'
011763 
011764 "'No, no, not the sole, not the sole, my dear young lady,' he
011765 cried. 'Your duty would be, as I am sure your good sense would
011766 suggest, to obey any little commands my wife might give, provided
011767 always that they were such commands as a lady might with
011768 propriety obey. You see no difficulty, heh?'
011769 
011770 "'I should be happy to make myself useful.'
011771 
011772 "'Quite so. In dress now, for example. We are faddy people, you
011773 know--faddy but kind-hearted. If you were asked to wear any dress
011774 which we might give you, you would not object to our little whim.
011775 Heh?'
011776 
011777 "'No,' said I, considerably astonished at his words.
011778 
011779 "'Or to sit here, or sit there, that would not be offensive to
011780 you?'
011781 
011782 "'Oh, no.'
011783 
011784 "'Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us?'
011785 
011786 "I could hardly believe my ears. As you may observe, Mr. Holmes,
011787 my hair is somewhat luxuriant, and of a rather peculiar tint of
011788 chestnut. It has been considered artistic. I could not dream of
011789 sacrificing it in this offhand fashion.
011790 
011791 "'I am afraid that that is quite impossible,' said I. He had been
011792 watching me eagerly out of his small eyes, and I could see a
011793 shadow pass over his face as I spoke.
011794 
011795 "'I am afraid that it is quite essential,' said he. 'It is a
011796 little fancy of my wife's, and ladies' fancies, you know, madam,
011797 ladies' fancies must be consulted. And so you won't cut your
011798 hair?'
011799 
011800 "'No, sir, I really could not,' I answered firmly.
011801 
011802 "'Ah, very well; then that quite settles the matter. It is a
011803 pity, because in other respects you would really have done very
011804 nicely. In that case, Miss Stoper, I had best inspect a few more
011805 of your young ladies.'
011806 
011807 "The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers
011808 without a word to either of us, but she glanced at me now with so
011809 much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting
011810 that she had lost a handsome commission through my refusal.
011811 
011812 "'Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books?' she asked.
011813 
011814 "'If you please, Miss Stoper.'
011815 
011816 "'Well, really, it seems rather useless, since you refuse the
011817 most excellent offers in this fashion,' said she sharply. 'You
011818 can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such
011819 opening for you. Good-day to you, Miss Hunter.' She struck a gong
011820 upon the table, and I was shown out by the page.
011821 
011822 "Well, Mr. Holmes, when I got back to my lodgings and found
011823 little enough in the cupboard, and two or three bills upon the
011824 table, I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very
011825 foolish thing. After all, if these people had strange fads and
011826 expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters, they were
011827 at least ready to pay for their eccentricity. Very few
011828 governesses in England are getting 100 pounds a year. Besides,
011829 what use was my hair to me? Many people are improved by wearing
011830 it short and perhaps I should be among the number. Next day I was
011831 inclined to think that I had made a mistake, and by the day after
011832 I was sure of it. I had almost overcome my pride so far as to go
011833 back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open
011834 when I received this letter from the gentleman himself. I have it
011835 here and I will read it to you:
011836 
011837                        "'The Copper Beeches, near Winchester.
011838 "'DEAR MISS HUNTER:--Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your
011839 address, and I write from here to ask you whether you have
011840 reconsidered your decision. My wife is very anxious that you
011841 should come, for she has been much attracted by my description of
011842 you. We are willing to give 30 pounds a quarter, or 120 pounds a
011843 year, so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which
011844 our fads may cause you. They are not very exacting, after all. My
011845 wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would
011846 like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning. You need
011847 not, however, go to the expense of purchasing one, as we have one
011848 belonging to my dear daughter Alice (now in Philadelphia), which
011849 would, I should think, fit you very well. Then, as to sitting
011850 here or there, or amusing yourself in any manner indicated, that
011851 need cause you no inconvenience. As regards your hair, it is no
011852 doubt a pity, especially as I could not help remarking its beauty
011853 during our short interview, but I am afraid that I must remain
011854 firm upon this point, and I only hope that the increased salary
011855 may recompense you for the loss. Your duties, as far as the child
011856 is concerned, are very light. Now do try to come, and I shall
011857 meet you with the dog-cart at Winchester. Let me know your train.
011858 Yours faithfully, JEPHRO RUCASTLE.'
011859 
011860 "That is the letter which I have just received, Mr. Holmes, and
011861 my mind is made up that I will accept it. I thought, however,
011862 that before taking the final step I should like to submit the
011863 whole matter to your consideration."
011864 
011865 "Well, Miss Hunter, if your mind is made up, that settles the
011866 question," said Holmes, smiling.
011867 
011868 "But you would not advise me to refuse?"
011869 
011870 "I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to
011871 see a sister of mine apply for."
011872 
011873 "What is the meaning of it all, Mr. Holmes?"
011874 
011875 "Ah, I have no data. I cannot tell. Perhaps you have yourself
011876 formed some opinion?"
011877 
011878 "Well, there seems to me to be only one possible solution. Mr.
011879 Rucastle seemed to be a very kind, good-natured man. Is it not
011880 possible that his wife is a lunatic, that he desires to keep the
011881 matter quiet for fear she should be taken to an asylum, and that
011882 he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an
011883 outbreak?"
011884 
011885 "That is a possible solution--in fact, as matters stand, it is
011886 the most probable one. But in any case it does not seem to be a
011887 nice household for a young lady."
011888 
011889 "But the money, Mr. Holmes, the money!"
011890 
011891 "Well, yes, of course the pay is good--too good. That is what
011892 makes me uneasy. Why should they give you 120 pounds a year, when
011893 they could have their pick for 40 pounds? There must be some
011894 strong reason behind."
011895 
011896 "I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would
011897 understand afterwards if I wanted your help. I should feel so
011898 much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me."
011899 
011900 "Oh, you may carry that feeling away with you. I assure you that
011901 your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has
011902 come my way for some months. There is something distinctly novel
011903 about some of the features. If you should find yourself in doubt
011904 or in danger--"
011905 
011906 "Danger! What danger do you foresee?"
011907 
011908 Holmes shook his head gravely. "It would cease to be a danger if
011909 we could define it," said he. "But at any time, day or night, a
011910 telegram would bring me down to your help."
011911 
011912 "That is enough." She rose briskly from her chair with the
011913 anxiety all swept from her face. "I shall go down to Hampshire
011914 quite easy in my mind now. I shall write to Mr. Rucastle at once,
011915 sacrifice my poor hair to-night, and start for Winchester
011916 to-morrow." With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both
011917 good-night and bustled off upon her way.
011918 
011919 "At least," said I as we heard her quick, firm steps descending
011920 the stairs, "she seems to be a young lady who is very well able
011921 to take care of herself."
011922 
011923 "And she would need to be," said Holmes gravely. "I am much
011924 mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past."
011925 
011926 It was not very long before my friend's prediction was fulfilled.
011927 A fortnight went by, during which I frequently found my thoughts
011928 turning in her direction and wondering what strange side-alley of
011929 human experience this lonely woman had strayed into. The unusual
011930 salary, the curious conditions, the light duties, all pointed to
011931 something abnormal, though whether a fad or a plot, or whether
011932 the man were a philanthropist or a villain, it was quite beyond
011933 my powers to determine. As to Holmes, I observed that he sat
011934 frequently for half an hour on end, with knitted brows and an
011935 abstracted air, but he swept the matter away with a wave of his
011936 hand when I mentioned it. "Data! data! data!" he cried
011937 impatiently. "I can't make bricks without clay." And yet he would
011938 always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever
011939 have accepted such a situation.
011940 
011941 The telegram which we eventually received came late one night
011942 just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down
011943 to one of those all-night chemical researches which he frequently
011944 indulged in, when I would leave him stooping over a retort and a
011945 test-tube at night and find him in the same position when I came
011946 down to breakfast in the morning. He opened the yellow envelope,
011947 and then, glancing at the message, threw it across to me.
011948 
011949 "Just look up the trains in Bradshaw," said he, and turned back
011950 to his chemical studies.
011951 
011952 The summons was a brief and urgent one.
011953 
011954 "Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday
011955 to-morrow," it said. "Do come! I am at my wit's end.  HUNTER."
011956 
011957 "Will you come with me?" asked Holmes, glancing up.
011958 
011959 "I should wish to."
011960 
011961 "Just look it up, then."
011962 
011963 "There is a train at half-past nine," said I, glancing over my
011964 Bradshaw. "It is due at Winchester at 11:30."
011965 
011966 "That will do very nicely. Then perhaps I had better postpone my
011967 analysis of the acetones, as we may need to be at our best in the
011968 morning."
011969 
011970 By eleven o'clock the next day we were well upon our way to the
011971 old English capital. Holmes had been buried in the morning papers
011972 all the way down, but after we had passed the Hampshire border he
011973 threw them down and began to admire the scenery. It was an ideal
011974 spring day, a light blue sky, flecked with little fleecy white
011975 clouds drifting across from west to east. The sun was shining
011976 very brightly, and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air,
011977 which set an edge to a man's energy. All over the countryside,
011978 away to the rolling hills around Aldershot, the little red and
011979 grey roofs of the farm-steadings peeped out from amid the light
011980 green of the new foliage.
011981 
011982 "Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I cried with all the
011983 enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.
011984 
011985 But Holmes shook his head gravely.
011986 
011987 "Do you know, Watson," said he, "that it is one of the curses of
011988 a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with
011989 reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered
011990 houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them,
011991 and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their
011992 isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed
011993 there."
011994 
011995 "Good heavens!" I cried. "Who would associate crime with these
011996 dear old homesteads?"
011997 
011998 "They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief,
011999 Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest
012000 alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin
012001 than does the smiling and beautiful countryside."
012002 
012003 "You horrify me!"
012004 
012005 "But the reason is very obvious. The pressure of public opinion
012006 can do in the town what the law cannot accomplish. There is no
012007 lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child, or the thud of
012008 a drunkard's blow, does not beget sympathy and indignation among
012009 the neighbours, and then the whole machinery of justice is ever
012010 so close that a word of complaint can set it going, and there is
012011 but a step between the crime and the dock. But look at these
012012 lonely houses, each in its own fields, filled for the most part
012013 with poor ignorant folk who know little of the law. Think of the
012014 deeds of hellish cruelty, the hidden wickedness which may go on,
012015 year in, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. Had this
012016 lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester, I
012017 should never have had a fear for her. It is the five miles of
012018 country which makes the danger. Still, it is clear that she is
012019 not personally threatened."
012020 
012021 "No. If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away."
012022 
012023 "Quite so. She has her freedom."
012024 
012025 "What CAN be the matter, then? Can you suggest no explanation?"
012026 
012027 "I have devised seven separate explanations, each of which would
012028 cover the facts as far as we know them. But which of these is
012029 correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we
012030 shall no doubt find waiting for us. Well, there is the tower of
012031 the cathedral, and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has
012032 to tell."
012033 
012034 The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street, at no
012035 distance from the station, and there we found the young lady
012036 waiting for us. She had engaged a sitting-room, and our lunch
012037 awaited us upon the table.
012038 
012039 "I am so delighted that you have come," she said earnestly. "It
012040 is so very kind of you both; but indeed I do not know what I
012041 should do. Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me."
012042 
012043 "Pray tell us what has happened to you."
012044 
012045 "I will do so, and I must be quick, for I have promised Mr.
012046 Rucastle to be back before three. I got his leave to come into
012047 town this morning, though he little knew for what purpose."
012048 
012049 "Let us have everything in its due order." Holmes thrust his long
012050 thin legs out towards the fire and composed himself to listen.
012051 
012052 "In the first place, I may say that I have met, on the whole,
012053 with no actual ill-treatment from Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle. It is
012054 only fair to them to say that. But I cannot understand them, and
012055 I am not easy in my mind about them."
012056 
012057 "What can you not understand?"
012058 
012059 "Their reasons for their conduct. But you shall have it all just
012060 as it occurred. When I came down, Mr. Rucastle met me here and
012061 drove me in his dog-cart to the Copper Beeches. It is, as he
012062 said, beautifully situated, but it is not beautiful in itself,
012063 for it is a large square block of a house, whitewashed, but all
012064 stained and streaked with damp and bad weather. There are grounds
012065 round it, woods on three sides, and on the fourth a field which
012066 slopes down to the Southampton highroad, which curves past about
012067 a hundred yards from the front door. This ground in front belongs
012068 to the house, but the woods all round are part of Lord
012069 Southerton's preserves. A clump of copper beeches immediately in
012070 front of the hall door has given its name to the place.
012071 
012072 "I was driven over by my employer, who was as amiable as ever,
012073 and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child.
012074 There was no truth, Mr. Holmes, in the conjecture which seemed to
012075 us to be probable in your rooms at Baker Street. Mrs. Rucastle is
012076 not mad. I found her to be a silent, pale-faced woman, much
012077 younger than her husband, not more than thirty, I should think,
012078 while he can hardly be less than forty-five. From their
012079 conversation I have gathered that they have been married about
012080 seven years, that he was a widower, and that his only child by
012081 the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia. Mr.
012082 Rucastle told me in private that the reason why she had left them
012083 was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother. As
012084 the daughter could not have been less than twenty, I can quite
012085 imagine that her position must have been uncomfortable with her
012086 father's young wife.
012087 
012088 "Mrs. Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as
012089 in feature. She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse.
012090 She was a nonentity. It was easy to see that she was passionately
012091 devoted both to her husband and to her little son. Her light grey
012092 eyes wandered continually from one to the other, noting every
012093 little want and forestalling it if possible. He was kind to her
012094 also in his bluff, boisterous fashion, and on the whole they
012095 seemed to be a happy couple. And yet she had some secret sorrow,
012096 this woman. She would often be lost in deep thought, with the
012097 saddest look upon her face. More than once I have surprised her
012098 in tears. I have thought sometimes that it was the disposition of
012099 her child which weighed upon her mind, for I have never met so
012100 utterly spoiled and so ill-natured a little creature. He is small
012101 for his age, with a head which is quite disproportionately large.
012102 His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between
012103 savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking. Giving
012104 pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea
012105 of amusement, and he shows quite remarkable talent in planning
012106 the capture of mice, little birds, and insects. But I would
012107 rather not talk about the creature, Mr. Holmes, and, indeed, he
012108 has little to do with my story."
012109 
012110 "I am glad of all details," remarked my friend, "whether they
012111 seem to you to be relevant or not."
012112 
012113 "I shall try not to miss anything of importance. The one
012114 unpleasant thing about the house, which struck me at once, was
012115 the appearance and conduct of the servants. There are only two, a
012116 man and his wife. Toller, for that is his name, is a rough,
012117 uncouth man, with grizzled hair and whiskers, and a perpetual
012118 smell of drink. Twice since I have been with them he has been
012119 quite drunk, and yet Mr. Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it.
012120 His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face, as
012121 silent as Mrs. Rucastle and much less amiable. They are a most
012122 unpleasant couple, but fortunately I spend most of my time in the
012123 nursery and my own room, which are next to each other in one
012124 corner of the building.
012125 
012126 "For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was
012127 very quiet; on the third, Mrs. Rucastle came down just after
012128 breakfast and whispered something to her husband.
012129 
012130 "'Oh, yes,' said he, turning to me, 'we are very much obliged to
012131 you, Miss Hunter, for falling in with our whims so far as to cut
012132 your hair. I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest
012133 iota from your appearance. We shall now see how the electric-blue
012134 dress will become you. You will find it laid out upon the bed in
012135 your room, and if you would be so good as to put it on we should
012136 both be extremely obliged.'
012137 
012138 "The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade
012139 of blue. It was of excellent material, a sort of beige, but it
012140 bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before. It could not
012141 have been a better fit if I had been measured for it. Both Mr.
012142 and Mrs. Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it, which
012143 seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence. They were waiting for
012144 me in the drawing-room, which is a very large room, stretching
012145 along the entire front of the house, with three long windows
012146 reaching down to the floor. A chair had been placed close to the
012147 central window, with its back turned towards it. In this I was
012148 asked to sit, and then Mr. Rucastle, walking up and down on the
012149 other side of the room, began to tell me a series of the funniest
012150 stories that I have ever listened to. You cannot imagine how
012151 comical he was, and I laughed until I was quite weary. Mrs.
012152 Rucastle, however, who has evidently no sense of humour, never so
012153 much as smiled, but sat with her hands in her lap, and a sad,
012154 anxious look upon her face. After an hour or so, Mr. Rucastle
012155 suddenly remarked that it was time to commence the duties of the
012156 day, and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in
012157 the nursery.
012158 
012159 "Two days later this same performance was gone through under
012160 exactly similar circumstances. Again I changed my dress, again I
012161 sat in the window, and again I laughed very heartily at the funny
012162 stories of which my employer had an immense rpertoire, and which
012163 he told inimitably. Then he handed me a yellow-backed novel, and
012164 moving my chair a little sideways, that my own shadow might not
012165 fall upon the page, he begged me to read aloud to him. I read for
012166 about ten minutes, beginning in the heart of a chapter, and then
012167 suddenly, in the middle of a sentence, he ordered me to cease and
012168 to change my dress.
012169 
012170 "You can easily imagine, Mr. Holmes, how curious I became as to
012171 what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly
012172 be. They were always very careful, I observed, to turn my face
012173 away from the window, so that I became consumed with the desire
012174 to see what was going on behind my back. At first it seemed to be
012175 impossible, but I soon devised a means. My hand-mirror had been
012176 broken, so a happy thought seized me, and I concealed a piece of
012177 the glass in my handkerchief. On the next occasion, in the midst
012178 of my laughter, I put my handkerchief up to my eyes, and was able
012179 with a little management to see all that there was behind me. I
012180 confess that I was disappointed. There was nothing. At least that
012181 was my first impression. At the second glance, however, I
012182 perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road,
012183 a small bearded man in a grey suit, who seemed to be looking in
012184 my direction. The road is an important highway, and there are
012185 usually people there. This man, however, was leaning against the
012186 railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly up. I
012187 lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs. Rucastle to find her
012188 eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze. She said nothing,
012189 but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my
012190 hand and had seen what was behind me. She rose at once.
012191 
012192 "'Jephro,' said she, 'there is an impertinent fellow upon the
012193 road there who stares up at Miss Hunter.'
012194 
012195 "'No friend of yours, Miss Hunter?' he asked.
012196 
012197 "'No, I know no one in these parts.'
012198 
012199 "'Dear me! How very impertinent! Kindly turn round and motion to
012200 him to go away.'
012201 
012202 "'Surely it would be better to take no notice.'
012203 
012204 "'No, no, we should have him loitering here always. Kindly turn
012205 round and wave him away like that.'
012206 
012207 "I did as I was told, and at the same instant Mrs. Rucastle drew
012208 down the blind. That was a week ago, and from that time I have
012209 not sat again in the window, nor have I worn the blue dress, nor
012210 seen the man in the road."
012211 
012212 "Pray continue," said Holmes. "Your narrative promises to be a
012213 most interesting one."
012214 
012215 "You will find it rather disconnected, I fear, and there may
012216 prove to be little relation between the different incidents of
012217 which I speak. On the very first day that I was at the Copper
012218 Beeches, Mr. Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands
012219 near the kitchen door. As we approached it I heard the sharp
012220 rattling of a chain, and the sound as of a large animal moving
012221 about.
012222 
012223 "'Look in here!' said Mr. Rucastle, showing me a slit between two
012224 planks. 'Is he not a beauty?'
012225 
012226 "I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes, and of a
012227 vague figure huddled up in the darkness.
012228 
012229 "'Don't be frightened,' said my employer, laughing at the start
012230 which I had given. 'It's only Carlo, my mastiff. I call him mine,
012231 but really old Toller, my groom, is the only man who can do
012232 anything with him. We feed him once a day, and not too much then,
012233 so that he is always as keen as mustard. Toller lets him loose
012234 every night, and God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs
012235 upon. For goodness' sake don't you ever on any pretext set your
012236 foot over the threshold at night, for it's as much as your life
012237 is worth.'
012238 
012239 "The warning was no idle one, for two nights later I happened to
012240 look out of my bedroom window about two o'clock in the morning.
012241 It was a beautiful moonlight night, and the lawn in front of the
012242 house was silvered over and almost as bright as day. I was
012243 standing, rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene, when I was
012244 aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper
012245 beeches. As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it was. It
012246 was a giant dog, as large as a calf, tawny tinted, with hanging
012247 jowl, black muzzle, and huge projecting bones. It walked slowly
012248 across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side.
012249 That dreadful sentinel sent a chill to my heart which I do not
012250 think that any burglar could have done.
012251 
012252 "And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as
012253 you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a
012254 great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the
012255 child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the
012256 furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things.
012257 There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones
012258 empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two
012259 with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was
012260 naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It
012261 struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight,
012262 so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very
012263 first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There
012264 was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never
012265 guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.
012266 
012267 "I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint,
012268 and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing
012269 obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in
012270 the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the
012271 contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two
012272 tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was
012273 it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at
012274 all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer,
012275 and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that
012276 I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had
012277 locked.
012278 
012279 "I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes,
012280 and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head.
012281 There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited
012282 at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of
012283 the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked.
012284 One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle
012285 coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on
012286 his face which made him a very different person to the round,
012287 jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his
012288 brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his
012289 temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me
012290 without a word or a look.
012291 
012292 "This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the
012293 grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I
012294 could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four
012295 of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the
012296 fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I
012297 strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle
012298 came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.
012299 
012300 "'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you
012301 without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with
012302 business matters.'
012303 
012304 "I assured him that I was not offended. 'By the way,' said I,
012305 'you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there, and one
012306 of them has the shutters up.'
012307 
012308 "He looked surprised and, as it seemed to me, a little startled
012309 at my remark.
012310 
012311 "'Photography is one of my hobbies,' said he. 'I have made my
012312 dark room up there. But, dear me! what an observant young lady we
012313 have come upon. Who would have believed it? Who would have ever
012314 believed it?' He spoke in a jesting tone, but there was no jest
012315 in his eyes as he looked at me. I read suspicion there and
012316 annoyance, but no jest.
012317 
012318 "Well, Mr. Holmes, from the moment that I understood that there
012319 was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know,
012320 I was all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity,
012321 though I have my share of that. It was more a feeling of duty--a
012322 feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this
012323 place. They talk of woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's
012324 instinct which gave me that feeling. At any rate, it was there,
012325 and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the
012326 forbidden door.
012327 
012328 "It was only yesterday that the chance came. I may tell you that,
012329 besides Mr. Rucastle, both Toller and his wife find something to
012330 do in these deserted rooms, and I once saw him carrying a large
012331 black linen bag with him through the door. Recently he has been
012332 drinking hard, and yesterday evening he was very drunk; and when
012333 I came upstairs there was the key in the door. I have no doubt at
012334 all that he had left it there. Mr. and Mrs. Rucastle were both
012335 downstairs, and the child was with them, so that I had an
012336 admirable opportunity. I turned the key gently in the lock,
012337 opened the door, and slipped through.
012338 
012339 "There was a little passage in front of me, unpapered and
012340 uncarpeted, which turned at a right angle at the farther end.
012341 Round this corner were three doors in a line, the first and third
012342 of which were open. They each led into an empty room, dusty and
012343 cheerless, with two windows in the one and one in the other, so
012344 thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through
012345 them. The centre door was closed, and across the outside of it
012346 had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed, padlocked
012347 at one end to a ring in the wall, and fastened at the other with
012348 stout cord. The door itself was locked as well, and the key was
012349 not there. This barricaded door corresponded clearly with the
012350 shuttered window outside, and yet I could see by the glimmer from
012351 beneath it that the room was not in darkness. Evidently there was
012352 a skylight which let in light from above. As I stood in the
012353 passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it
012354 might veil, I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room
012355 and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little
012356 slit of dim light which shone out from under the door. A mad,
012357 unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight, Mr. Holmes. My
012358 overstrung nerves failed me suddenly, and I turned and ran--ran
012359 as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the
012360 skirt of my dress. I rushed down the passage, through the door,
012361 and straight into the arms of Mr. Rucastle, who was waiting
012362 outside.
012363 
012364 "'So,' said he, smiling, 'it was you, then. I thought that it
012365 must be when I saw the door open.'
012366 
012367 "'Oh, I am so frightened!' I panted.
012368 
012369 "'My dear young lady! my dear young lady!'--you cannot think how
012370 caressing and soothing his manner was--'and what has frightened
012371 you, my dear young lady?'
012372 
012373 "But his voice was just a little too coaxing. He overdid it. I
012374 was keenly on my guard against him.
012375 
012376 "'I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing,' I answered.
012377 'But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was
012378 frightened and ran out again. Oh, it is so dreadfully still in
012379 there!'
012380 
012381 "'Only that?' said he, looking at me keenly.
012382 
012383 "'Why, what did you think?' I asked.
012384 
012385 "'Why do you think that I lock this door?'
012386 
012387 "'I am sure that I do not know.'
012388 
012389 "'It is to keep people out who have no business there. Do you
012390 see?' He was still smiling in the most amiable manner.
012391 
012392 "'I am sure if I had known--'
012393 
012394 "'Well, then, you know now. And if you ever put your foot over
012395 that threshold again'--here in an instant the smile hardened into
012396 a grin of rage, and he glared down at me with the face of a
012397 demon--'I'll throw you to the mastiff.'
012398 
012399 "I was so terrified that I do not know what I did. I suppose that
012400 I must have rushed past him into my room. I remember nothing
012401 until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over. Then I
012402 thought of you, Mr. Holmes. I could not live there longer without
012403 some advice. I was frightened of the house, of the man, of the
012404 woman, of the servants, even of the child. They were all horrible
012405 to me. If I could only bring you down all would be well. Of
012406 course I might have fled from the house, but my curiosity was
012407 almost as strong as my fears. My mind was soon made up. I would
012408 send you a wire. I put on my hat and cloak, went down to the
012409 office, which is about half a mile from the house, and then
012410 returned, feeling very much easier. A horrible doubt came into my
012411 mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose, but I
012412 remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of
012413 insensibility that evening, and I knew that he was the only one
012414 in the household who had any influence with the savage creature,
012415 or who would venture to set him free. I slipped in in safety and
012416 lay awake half the night in my joy at the thought of seeing you.
012417 I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this
012418 morning, but I must be back before three o'clock, for Mr. and
012419 Mrs. Rucastle are going on a visit, and will be away all the
012420 evening, so that I must look after the child. Now I have told you
012421 all my adventures, Mr. Holmes, and I should be very glad if you
012422 could tell me what it all means, and, above all, what I should
012423 do."
012424 
012425 Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story.
012426 My friend rose now and paced up and down the room, his hands in
012427 his pockets, and an expression of the most profound gravity upon
012428 his face.
012429 
012430 "Is Toller still drunk?" he asked.
012431 
012432 "Yes. I heard his wife tell Mrs. Rucastle that she could do
012433 nothing with him."
012434 
012435 "That is well. And the Rucastles go out to-night?"
012436 
012437 "Yes."
012438 
012439 "Is there a cellar with a good strong lock?"
012440 
012441 "Yes, the wine-cellar."
012442 
012443 "You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very
012444 brave and sensible girl, Miss Hunter. Do you think that you could
012445 perform one more feat? I should not ask it of you if I did not
012446 think you a quite exceptional woman."
012447 
012448 "I will try. What is it?"
012449 
012450 "We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o'clock, my friend
012451 and I. The Rucastles will be gone by that time, and Toller will,
012452 we hope, be incapable. There only remains Mrs. Toller, who might
012453 give the alarm. If you could send her into the cellar on some
012454 errand, and then turn the key upon her, you would facilitate
012455 matters immensely."
012456 
012457 "I will do it."
012458 
012459 "Excellent! We shall then look thoroughly into the affair. Of
012460 course there is only one feasible explanation. You have been
012461 brought there to personate someone, and the real person is
012462 imprisoned in this chamber. That is obvious. As to who this
012463 prisoner is, I have no doubt that it is the daughter, Miss Alice
012464 Rucastle, if I remember right, who was said to have gone to
012465 America. You were chosen, doubtless, as resembling her in height,
012466 figure, and the colour of your hair. Hers had been cut off, very
012467 possibly in some illness through which she has passed, and so, of
012468 course, yours had to be sacrificed also. By a curious chance you
012469 came upon her tresses. The man in the road was undoubtedly some
012470 friend of hers--possibly her fianc--and no doubt, as you wore
012471 the girl's dress and were so like her, he was convinced from your
012472 laughter, whenever he saw you, and afterwards from your gesture,
012473 that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy, and that she no longer
012474 desired his attentions. The dog is let loose at night to prevent
012475 him from endeavouring to communicate with her. So much is fairly
012476 clear. The most serious point in the case is the disposition of
012477 the child."
012478 
012479 "What on earth has that to do with it?" I ejaculated.
012480 
012481 "My dear Watson, you as a medical man are continually gaining
012482 light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the
012483 parents. Don't you see that the converse is equally valid. I have
012484 frequently gained my first real insight into the character of
012485 parents by studying their children. This child's disposition is
012486 abnormally cruel, merely for cruelty's sake, and whether he
012487 derives this from his smiling father, as I should suspect, or
012488 from his mother, it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their
012489 power."
012490 
012491 "I am sure that you are right, Mr. Holmes," cried our client. "A
012492 thousand things come back to me which make me certain that you
012493 have hit it. Oh, let us lose not an instant in bringing help to
012494 this poor creature."
012495 
012496 "We must be circumspect, for we are dealing with a very cunning
012497 man. We can do nothing until seven o'clock. At that hour we shall
012498 be with you, and it will not be long before we solve the
012499 mystery."
012500 
012501 We were as good as our word, for it was just seven when we
012502 reached the Copper Beeches, having put up our trap at a wayside
012503 public-house. The group of trees, with their dark leaves shining
012504 like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun, were
012505 sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been
012506 standing smiling on the door-step.
012507 
012508 "Have you managed it?" asked Holmes.
012509 
012510 A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs. "That is
012511 Mrs. Toller in the cellar," said she. "Her husband lies snoring
012512 on the kitchen rug. Here are his keys, which are the duplicates
012513 of Mr. Rucastle's."
012514 
012515 "You have done well indeed!" cried Holmes with enthusiasm. "Now
012516 lead the way, and we shall soon see the end of this black
012517 business."
012518 
012519 We passed up the stair, unlocked the door, followed on down a
012520 passage, and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss
012521 Hunter had described. Holmes cut the cord and removed the
012522 transverse bar. Then he tried the various keys in the lock, but
012523 without success. No sound came from within, and at the silence
012524 Holmes' face clouded over.
012525 
012526 "I trust that we are not too late," said he. "I think, Miss
012527 Hunter, that we had better go in without you. Now, Watson, put
012528 your shoulder to it, and we shall see whether we cannot make our
012529 way in."
012530 
012531 It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united
012532 strength. Together we rushed into the room. It was empty. There
012533 was no furniture save a little pallet bed, a small table, and a
012534 basketful of linen. The skylight above was open, and the prisoner
012535 gone.
012536 
012537 "There has been some villainy here," said Holmes; "this beauty
012538 has guessed Miss Hunter's intentions and has carried his victim
012539 off."
012540 
012541 "But how?"
012542 
012543 "Through the skylight. We shall soon see how he managed it." He
012544 swung himself up onto the roof. "Ah, yes," he cried, "here's the
012545 end of a long light ladder against the eaves. That is how he did
012546 it."
012547 
012548 "But it is impossible," said Miss Hunter; "the ladder was not
012549 there when the Rucastles went away."
012550 
012551 "He has come back and done it. I tell you that he is a clever and
012552 dangerous man. I should not be very much surprised if this were
012553 he whose step I hear now upon the stair. I think, Watson, that it
012554 would be as well for you to have your pistol ready."
012555 
012556 The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at
012557 the door of the room, a very fat and burly man, with a heavy
012558 stick in his hand. Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the
012559 wall at the sight of him, but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and
012560 confronted him.
012561 
012562 "You villain!" said he, "where's your daughter?"
012563 
012564 The fat man cast his eyes round, and then up at the open
012565 skylight.
012566 
012567 "It is for me to ask you that," he shrieked, "you thieves! Spies
012568 and thieves! I have caught you, have I? You are in my power. I'll
012569 serve you!" He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he
012570 could go.
012571 
012572 "He's gone for the dog!" cried Miss Hunter.
012573 
012574 "I have my revolver," said I.
012575 
012576 "Better close the front door," cried Holmes, and we all rushed
012577 down the stairs together. We had hardly reached the hall when we
012578 heard the baying of a hound, and then a scream of agony, with a
012579 horrible worrying sound which it was dreadful to listen to. An
012580 elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out
012581 at a side door.
012582 
012583 "My God!" he cried. "Someone has loosed the dog. It's not been
012584 fed for two days. Quick, quick, or it'll be too late!"
012585 
012586 Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house, with
012587 Toller hurrying behind us. There was the huge famished brute, its
012588 black muzzle buried in Rucastle's throat, while he writhed and
012589 screamed upon the ground. Running up, I blew its brains out, and
012590 it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great
012591 creases of his neck. With much labour we separated them and
012592 carried him, living but horribly mangled, into the house. We laid
012593 him upon the drawing-room sofa, and having dispatched the sobered
012594 Toller to bear the news to his wife, I did what I could to
012595 relieve his pain. We were all assembled round him when the door
012596 opened, and a tall, gaunt woman entered the room.
012597 
012598 "Mrs. Toller!" cried Miss Hunter.
012599 
012600 "Yes, miss. Mr. Rucastle let me out when he came back before he
012601 went up to you. Ah, miss, it is a pity you didn't let me know
012602 what you were planning, for I would have told you that your pains
012603 were wasted."
012604 
012605 "Ha!" said Holmes, looking keenly at her. "It is clear that Mrs.
012606 Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else."
012607 
012608 "Yes, sir, I do, and I am ready enough to tell what I know."
012609 
012610 "Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several
012611 points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark."
012612 
012613 "I will soon make it clear to you," said she; "and I'd have done
012614 so before now if I could ha' got out from the cellar. If there's
012615 police-court business over this, you'll remember that I was the
012616 one that stood your friend, and that I was Miss Alice's friend
012617 too.
012618 
012619 "She was never happy at home, Miss Alice wasn't, from the time
012620 that her father married again. She was slighted like and had no
012621 say in anything, but it never really became bad for her until
012622 after she met Mr. Fowler at a friend's house. As well as I could
012623 learn, Miss Alice had rights of her own by will, but she was so
012624 quiet and patient, she was, that she never said a word about them
012625 but just left everything in Mr. Rucastle's hands. He knew he was
012626 safe with her; but when there was a chance of a husband coming
012627 forward, who would ask for all that the law would give him, then
012628 her father thought it time to put a stop on it. He wanted her to
012629 sign a paper, so that whether she married or not, he could use
012630 her money. When she wouldn't do it, he kept on worrying her until
012631 she got brain-fever, and for six weeks was at death's door. Then
012632 she got better at last, all worn to a shadow, and with her
012633 beautiful hair cut off; but that didn't make no change in her
012634 young man, and he stuck to her as true as man could be."
012635 
012636 "Ah," said Holmes, "I think that what you have been good enough
012637 to tell us makes the matter fairly clear, and that I can deduce
012638 all that remains. Mr. Rucastle then, I presume, took to this
012639 system of imprisonment?"
012640 
012641 "Yes, sir."
012642 
012643 "And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of
012644 the disagreeable persistence of Mr. Fowler."
012645 
012646 "That was it, sir."
012647 
012648 "But Mr. Fowler being a persevering man, as a good seaman should
012649 be, blockaded the house, and having met you succeeded by certain
012650 arguments, metallic or otherwise, in convincing you that your
012651 interests were the same as his."
012652 
012653 "Mr. Fowler was a very kind-spoken, free-handed gentleman," said
012654 Mrs. Toller serenely.
012655 
012656 "And in this way he managed that your good man should have no
012657 want of drink, and that a ladder should be ready at the moment
012658 when your master had gone out."
012659 
012660 "You have it, sir, just as it happened."
012661 
012662 "I am sure we owe you an apology, Mrs. Toller," said Holmes, "for
012663 you have certainly cleared up everything which puzzled us. And
012664 here comes the country surgeon and Mrs. Rucastle, so I think,
012665 Watson, that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester,
012666 as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a
012667 questionable one."
012668 
012669 And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the
012670 copper beeches in front of the door. Mr. Rucastle survived, but
012671 was always a broken man, kept alive solely through the care of
012672 his devoted wife. They still live with their old servants, who
012673 probably know so much of Rucastle's past life that he finds it
012674 difficult to part from them. Mr. Fowler and Miss Rucastle were
012675 married, by special license, in Southampton the day after their
012676 flight, and he is now the holder of a government appointment in
012677 the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend
012678 Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further
012679 interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one
012680 of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
012681 Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.

012705 Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no

012708 permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
012709 set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
012710 copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
012711 protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
012712 Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you

012715 rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
012716 such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and

012726 THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
012727 PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK
012728 
012729 To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
012730 distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
012731 (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
012732 Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
012733 Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
012734 http://gutenberg.net/license).
012735 
012736 
012737 Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
012738 electronic works
012739 
012740 1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
012741 electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
012742 and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
012743 (trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
012744 the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
012745 all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
012746 If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
012747 Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
012748 terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
012749 entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
012750 
012751 1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
012752 used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
012753 agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
012754 things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
012755 even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
012756 paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
012757 Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
012758 and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
012759 works.  See paragraph 1.E below.
012760 
012761 1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
012762 or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
012763 Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
012764 collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
012765 individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
012766 located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
012767 copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
012768 works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
012769 are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
012770 Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
012771 freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
012772 this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
012773 the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
012774 keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
012775 Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.
012776 
012777 1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
012778 what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
012779 a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
012780 the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
012781 before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
012782 creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
012783 Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
012784 the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
012785 States.
012786 
012787 1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
012788 
012789 1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
012790 access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
012791 whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
012792 phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
012793 Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
012794 copied or distributed:
012795 
012796 This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
012797 almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or

012799 with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net
012800 
012801 1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
012802 from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
012803 posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
012804 and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
012805 or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
012806 with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
012807 work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
012808 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
012809 Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
012810 1.E.9.
012811 
012812 1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
012813 with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
012814 must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
012815 terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
012816 to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
012817 permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.
012818 
012819 1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
012820 License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
012821 work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.
012822 
012823 1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
012824 electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
012825 prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
012826 active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
012827 Gutenberg-tm License.
012828 
012829 1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
012830 compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
012831 word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
012832 distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
012833 "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
012834 posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
012835 you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
012836 copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
012837 request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
012838 form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
012839 License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
012840 
012841 1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
012842 performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
012843 unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
012844 
012845 1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
012846 access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
012847 that
012848 
012849 - You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
012850      the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
012851      you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
012852      owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
012853      has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
012854      Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
012855      must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
012856      prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
012857      returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
012858      sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
012859      address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
012860      the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."
012861 
012862 - You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
012863      you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
012864      does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
012865      License.  You must require such a user to return or
012866      destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
012867      and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
012868      Project Gutenberg-tm works.
012869 
012870 - You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
012871      money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
012872      electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
012873      of receipt of the work.
012874 
012875 - You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
012876      distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.
012877 
012878 1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
012879 electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
012880 forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
012881 both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
012882 Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
012883 Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.
012884 
012885 1.F.
012886 
012887 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
012888 effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
012889 public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
012890 collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
012891 works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
012892 "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
012893 corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
012894 property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
012895 computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
012896 your equipment.
012897 
012898 1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
012899 of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
012900 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
012901 Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
012902 Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
012903 liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
012904 fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
012905 LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
012906 PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
012907 TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
012908 LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
012909 INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
012910 DAMAGE.
012911 
012912 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
012913 defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
012914 receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
012915 written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
012916 received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
012917 your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
012918 the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
012919 refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
012920 providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
012921 receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
012922 is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
012923 opportunities to fix the problem.
012924 
012925 1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
012926 in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
012927 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
012928 WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
012929 
012930 1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
012931 warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
012932 If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
012933 law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
012934 interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
012935 the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
012936 provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.
012937 
012938 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
012939 trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
012940 providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
012941 with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
012942 promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
012943 harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
012944 that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
012945 or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
012946 work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
012947 Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.
012948 
012949 
012950 Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
012951 
012952 Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
012953 electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
012954 including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
012955 because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
012956 people in all walks of life.
012957 
012958 Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
012959 assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
012960 goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
012961 remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
012962 Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
012963 and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
012964 To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
012965 and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

012995 Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
012996 Literary Archive Foundation
012997 
012998 Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
012999 spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
013000 increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
013001 freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
013002 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
013003 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
013004 status with the IRS.
013005 
013006 The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
013007 charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
013008 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
013009 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
013010 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
013011 where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
013012 SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any

013015 While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
013016 have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
013017 against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
013018 approach us with offers to donate.
013019 
013020 International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
013021 any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
013022 outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
013023 
013024 Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
013025 methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
013026 ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
013027 donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate

013031 works.

013033 Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
013034 concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
013035 with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
013036 Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.
013037 
013038 
013039 Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
013040 editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
013041 unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
013042 keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
